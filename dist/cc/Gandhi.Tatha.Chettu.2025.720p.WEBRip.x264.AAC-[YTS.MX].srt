00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,791
<i>Hello!</i>

4
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>Here I am.</i>

5
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,416
<i>Here, look!</i>

6
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,666
<i>Come.</i>

7
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,375
<i>Come, you can sit in my shade.</i>

8
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,625
<i>There it is. You see this place?</i>

9
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,166
<i>This is my village.</i>

10
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,583
<i>My village is filled with goodness.</i>

11
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,958
<i>The villagers too...</i>

12
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,250
<i>are very good people.</i>

13
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,416
<i>Every tree probably thinks</i>
<i>that about its own village.</i>

14
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,541
<i>My respected Ramachandrayya always says,</i>

15
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,791
<i>When you look at things with a good heart,</i>

16
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,125
<i>everything will look good, son.</i>

17
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,625
<i>His heart is kind.</i>

18
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,041
<i>His words are even kinder.</i>

19
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,375
<i>You wouldn't know Ramachandrayya,</i>
<i>would you?</i>

20
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,625
<i>You're standing in my shadow, right?</i>

21
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,875
<i>That shade is his.</i>

22
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,875
<i>I see the world through his eyes.</i>

23
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,875
<i>I grew up with him.</i>

24
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,125
<i>My Ramachandrayya shares</i>
<i>everything with me.</i>

25
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,666
<i>He is my world.</i>

26
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,916
<i>He is my life.</i>

27
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:09,416
<i>He planted me when </i>
<i>Mahatma Gandhi passed away.</i>

28
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,416
<i>I was once just a tiny sapling...</i>

29
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,125
<i>and now, I'm so big!</i>

30
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,000
<i>My Ramchandrayya adores Mahatma Gandhi.</i>

31
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,750
<i>He's always reading about</i>
<i>Gandhi's life story.</i>

32
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,916
<i>Always talking about his life.</i>

33
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,583
<i>My Ramchandrayya has a granddaughter too.</i>

34
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,083
<i>Can you guess her name?</i>

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,958
<i>Look how she giggles with joy.</i>

36
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,250
<i>Shall we name her 'Gandhi'?</i>

37
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,458
<i>Oh father, Gandhi is not a girl's name.</i>

38
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:49,000
<i>It's a name the whole world admires.</i>
<i>Why can't it be a girl's name?</i>

39
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,541
<i>Let's name her Gandhi.</i>

40
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,250
<i>Gandhi!</i>

41
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,541
<i>You like the name, don't you?</i>

42
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,583
<i>Ah! Look, she likes it!</i>

43
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,625
<i>The baby girl likes Gandhi!</i>

44
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,208
<i>Your name is Gandhi, okay?</i>

45
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,333
<i>This story belongs to us.</i>

46
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,250
<i>Gandhi, Grandfather and Tree.</i>

47
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
<i>Gandhi?</i>

48
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,708
<i>Gandhi.</i>

49
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,541
<i>Dear.</i>

50
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,166
<i>What is it, Grandpa?</i>

51
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,416
<i>Wake up, child.</i>

52
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,458
<i>You have to go to school. Get up, dear.</i>

53
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,666
<i>Get up.</i>

54
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,083
<i>Did you study well for the exam?</i>

55
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,500
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

56
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,291
<i>Where are you off to so early?</i>

57
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,833
<i>I am going to the temple, dear.</i>

58
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,791
<i>I'm going to pray that you do well</i>
<i>in the exam.</i>

59
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,041
<i>Here's some money for your laddus.</i>

60
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,791
<i>My grandfather never fails to</i>
<i>remember this.</i>

61
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,375
<i>Can I leave now?</i>

62
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,083
<i>Yes, all right.</i>

63
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:09,666
<i>Grandpa...</i>

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,291
<i>Yes, dear.</i>

65
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,875
<i>Be careful when climbing and </i>
<i>descending the stairs. Okay?</i>

66
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,541
<i>Okay, dear. </i>

67
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,291
<i>Shall I leave now? </i>

68
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,666
- <i>All the best. Okay?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

69
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,916
<i>I'll see you soon. </i>
<i>My little princess.</i>

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,083
<i>Father, father</i>

71
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,375
<i>What?</i>

72
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,791
<i>I'm leaving for school.</i>
<i>I have my exam today.</i>

73
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,333
<i>So? Why wake me up?</i>

74
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,166
<i>You want me to write the exam?</i>

75
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,958
<i>Let it be. You sleep.</i>

76
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,791
<i>Father, father...</i>

77
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,125
<i>Girl, what is your problem?</i>

78
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,458
<i>You are going to the town, aren't you?</i>

79
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,541
<i>Can you get a new pair of slippers</i>
<i>for Mom, please?</i>

80
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,916
<i>The old ones are torn. Poor thing, </i>
<i>she walks bare feet everywhere.</i>

81
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,583
<i>Okay, you can go.</i>

82
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,625
<i>Daddy...</i>

83
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,958
<i>What is it now?</i>

84
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,458
<i>Won't you wish me 'All the best'?</i>

85
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,166
<i>If I wish you 'All the best,'</i>
<i>will you get good marks?</i>

86
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,583
<i>If you write well, you'll pass.</i>

87
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,041
<i>Else, you'll fail.</i>

88
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,125
<i>Also, you are a girl.</i>

89
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,458
<i>Whether you pass or fail,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter.</i>

90
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,625
<i>Don't wake me up again or I'll slap you.</i>

91
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,458
<i>Okay... sleep.</i>

92
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,875
<i>Hey child! Don't run!</i>

93
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,333
<i>You'll spoil my Rangoli design.</i>

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,125
<i>What is that hair?</i>
<i>You look like a mad woman.</i>

95
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,416
<i>Wait, let me braid it.</i>

96
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,416
<i>I braided my hair myself.</i>
<i>Does it not look good?</i>

97
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,458
<i>It's terrible.</i>
<i>You look like a begger woman.</i>

98
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,500
<i>If anyone sees, they'll think</i>
<i>you're a beggar.</i>

99
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,666
<i>Why should we care what others think, Ma?</i>

100
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,458
<i>Bah!</i>

101
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,833
<i>Don't argue with me</i>
<i>so early in the morning.</i>

102
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:12,958
<i>Do whatever you want. Go.</i>

103
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,458
<i>Ma, did you forget I have an exam today?</i>

104
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,375
<i>Oh no, I forgot!</i>

105
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,833
<i>Take this with you.</i>

106
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,791
<i>Give this money to the shopkeeper.</i>

107
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,375
<i>- Did you pack your lunchbox?</i>
<i>- Yes, I did!</i>

108
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,333
<i>Eat it yourself.</i>
<i>Don't share your lunch with anyone.</i>

109
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,250
<i>I've made your favorite potato curry.</i>

110
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,916
<i>- Okay?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

111
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,958
<i>I'll eat some and share some</i>
<i>with Mallesh and Chenulu.</i>

112
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,833
<i>They just love your potato curry.</i>

113
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,875
<i>Again you talk of sharing. Don't their</i>
<i>mothers know how to cook potato curry?</i>

114
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,625
<i>Why do they always eat your lunch?</i>

115
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,000
<i>Okay Ma, I'm getting late.</i>

116
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,291
<i>I'll leave now.</i>

117
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,208
<i>Go carefully!</i>

118
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,250
<i>How will she even survive in this world!</i>

119
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,208
<i>Brother, Ma asked me to give you</i>
<i>this money.</i>

120
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,125
<i>Ah, you're my first customer today,</i>
<i>Gandhi.</i>

121
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,250
<i>Brother, give me two sesame laddus.</i>

122
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,916
<i>Forget laddus, there's a new chocolate,</i>
<i>in the market.</i>

123
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,291
<i>I can't even pronounce its name...</i>

124
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,250
<i>- What chocolate, Brother?</i>
<i>- It's called, wait...</i>

125
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,541
<i>Alpinn... Something... I've kept it in</i>
<i>this box.</i>

126
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,958
<i>All the kids are asking for it.</i>

127
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,291
<i>Brotherâ€¦</i>

128
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,833
<i>None of these can match</i>
<i>sister's sesame laddus.</i>

129
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,791
<i>Give me two sesame laddus, Brother.</i>

130
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,333
<i>Seems like your sister makes these</i>
<i>laddus only for you.</i>

131
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,500
<i>No one else buys them.</i>

132
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,833
<i>Here's your change.</i>

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,625
<i>Brother, you gave me two rupees extra.</i>

134
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,041
<i>Oh...</i>

135
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,541
<i>My dear child!</i>
<i>How sweet of you to return the money.</i>

136
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,583
<i>I returned what is yours, Brother.</i>
<i>That's all.</i>

137
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,166
<i>I'm getting late for my exam.</i>

138
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,708
<i>Please give my regards to Sister.</i>

139
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,166
<i>Go</i>

140
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,708
<i>Go.</i>

141
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,458
<i>Go.</i>

142
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,708
<i>Psstâ€¦</i>

143
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,500
<i>Psstâ€¦ Malleshâ€¦</i>

144
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,375
<i>What is it?</i>

145
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,916
<i>Sir, Mallesh and Chenulu are copying.</i>

146
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,333
<i>Sir, don't hit us. It'll hurt, sir.</i>

147
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:57,333
<i>Are you some kind of flower,</i>
<i>that I'll treat you delicately?</i>

148
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,916
<i>Show me your palm. Show me your palm!</i>

149
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,375
<i>Sir... We were copying because</i>
<i>you hit us if we fail.</i>

150
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,708
<i>Else, why would we copy, sir?</i>

151
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,666
<i>Don't act smart with me.</i>

152
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,083
<i>I asked you to study well</i>
<i>and pass the exam.</i>

153
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,125
<i>Not to copy and pass the exam!</i>

154
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,541
<i>Mallesh!</i>

155
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,875
<i>Do you have any shame?</i>

156
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,166
<i>You're the village head's grandson.</i>
<i>Aren't you ashamed, copying in the exams?</i>

157
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,750
<i>Come, let's go meet your grandfather.</i>
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

158
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,875
<i>Sir, let's settle this between us.</i>
<i>Why bring my grandfather into this.</i>

159
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,125
<i>Show me your palm. Show me!</i>

160
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,208
<i>Sir!</i>

161
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,291
<i>Don't hit them, sir!</i>

162
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,583
<i>They will have pain.</i>

163
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,666
<i>Gandhi. You can't decide everything.</i>

164
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,541
<i>If you didn't want them punished,</i>
<i>why did you report them to me?</i>

165
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,416
<i>I wouldn't have noticed them.</i>

166
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,583
<i>You write your exam.</i>

167
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,250
<i>Sir, you can hit her instead of us.</i>

168
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,833
<i>You've gotten too smart these days.</i>

169
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,833
<i>- Sir...</i>
<i>- Sir...</i>

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>- Sir... Sir...</i>
<i>- Sir... Sir... Sir...</i>

171
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,833
<i>Look, Mr. Ramachandra... </i>
<i>What's the use of all the education?</i>

172
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,458
<i>You are educated and your father too...</i>
<i>But what are you doing?</i>

173
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,958
<i>You both are working in your fields, aren't you? </i>

174
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,875
<i>You educated your son too,</i>
<i>he too is unemployed. </i>

175
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,500
<i>Then, what's the use of education?</i>

176
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,875
<i>No matter how educated one is, </i>
<i>everyone feels the hunger, right?</i>

177
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,250
<i>If everyone quits agriculture, </i>
<i>how will the world get food? </i>

178
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,458
<i>Education gives you knowledge</i>
<i>and farming gives you food.</i>

179
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,375
<i>There is nothing wrong if a farmer gets educated,</i>

180
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,541
<i>similarly, there is nothing wrong in an </i>
<i>educated man choosing to do farming.</i>

181
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,125
<i>Shall I tell you one thing, Mr. Ramchandra?</i>

182
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,833
<i>Your son called my son who works in the city,</i>
<i>he was asking to look for a job for him. </i>

183
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,416
<i>He is educated, why don't you </i>
<i>send him to the city?</i>

184
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,500
<i>Look, Patela...</i>

185
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,208
<i>If he had ambition which requires him to </i>
<i>migrate to a city, I wouldn't have stopped him. </i>

186
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,625
<i>But he wants to go there to earn a livelihood. </i>

187
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,208
<i>There's a nice difference between</i>
<i>being successful and earning a livelihood.</i>

188
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,250
<i>For his education, he would, at most, </i>
<i>get a job as a watchman or a driver. </i>

189
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,291
<i>But he wouldn't understand this.</i>

190
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,375
<i>- Greetings, Sir.</i>
<i>- Greetings to you too, sir.</i>

191
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,750
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>What brings you all here?</i>

192
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,583
<i>Sir...</i>

193
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,541
<i>The factory refuses to</i>
<i>accept our sugarcane.</i>

194
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,666
<i>They are not paying us well either.</i>

195
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
<i>What? How can they do this?</i>

196
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,208
<i>No idea, sir.</i>
<i>We don't know why they are doing so.</i>

197
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,583
<i>Didn't you ask them?</i>

198
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,875
<i>We did. They said</i>
<i>the quality isn't good enough.</i>

199
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,416
<i>The factory is apparently in losses, sir.</i>
<i>I heard they might shut it down.</i>

200
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,125
<i>My brother-in-law works at the factory.</i>

201
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,125
<i>He told me the other day. I told them</i>
<i>but they don't believe me.</i>

202
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,500
<i>What are you saying, Sampath?</i>

203
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,375
<i>How can they close the factory?</i>

204
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,041
<i>We took loans to grow our sugarcane. If</i>
<i>they close the factory, we'll be doomed.</i>

205
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,250
<i>Don't talk rubbish.</i>
<i>They won't close the factory.</i>

206
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,208
<i>Why would I lie about such</i>
<i>a thing, brother?</i>

207
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,208
<i>Even I've planted sugarcane</i>
<i>like all of you.</i>

208
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,750
<i>Stop. Now that you've brought this to me,</i>
<i>I'll look into the matter.</i>

209
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,291
<i>- Go.</i>
<i>- Alright, sir.</i>

210
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,583
<i>- We'll take your leave, sir.</i>
<i>- Thank you, sir.</i>

211
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,000
<i>What do you think, Ramachandrayya?</i>

212
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,625
<i>I don't know. We'll have to see.</i>

213
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,041
<i>If they do close the factory,</i>
<i>the whole village will suffer.</i>

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
<i>Do one thing.</i>

215
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,375
<i>Ask the Minister. He will know better.</i>

216
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,916
<i>What is this, Diwakar? Why are you so late?</i>

217
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,666
<i>What were you doing there this long?</i>

218
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,166
<i>Have you started already, without me?</i>

219
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,458
<i>Started? Gappi has finished three pots already.</i>

220
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,375
<i>Good going, Gappi.</i>

221
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,000
<i>Here, pour some.</i>

222
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,375
<i>Diwakar, your father is coming...</i>

223
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,458
<i>I don't like such petty jokes.</i>

224
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,250
<i>Why are you scared of your father?</i>

225
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,250
<i>What will he do? He will give you a long lecture. That's it, right?</i>

226
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,000
<i>That's enough to kill a person.</i>

227
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,833
- <i>By the way, are you staying back tomorrow as well?</i>
<i>- I'm leaving early in the morning. </i>

228
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,166
<i>Tomorrow if I don't report to the office, </i>
<i>my boss will kill me.</i>

229
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,458
<i>Dude, please take me along with you.</i>

230
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,791
<i>Look for a job for me in the city, </i>
<i>I'll go mad staying in this village.</i>

231
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,375
<i>You've been saying this for the last 10 years. </i>

232
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,291
<i>Come, I'll take you and get a job for you, will you? </i>

233
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,125
<i>I know you wouldn't, then why do you speak of it? </i>

234
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,291
<i>Moreover, will your father let you leave?</i>

235
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,625
<i>No, I'll come this time.</i>

236
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,625
<i>Okay, let's see. </i>

237
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,375
<i>I've heard you say this many times in the past.</i>

238
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,583
- <i>But this time, I'll come...</i>
<i>- Okay, let's see.</i>

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,125
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

240
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,291
<i>You got us scolded by the teacher. Mental!</i>

241
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,375
<i>Will you sleep peacefully tonight? Weirdo.</i>

242
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,500
<i>Guys, I got you caught for your own good!</i>

243
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,791
<i>Our good? We're going to fail,</i>
<i>how is that good?</i>

244
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,416
<i>Now we'll get hit at home too!</i>

245
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,625
<i>I got you two caught</i>
<i>because you were copying.</i>

246
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,500
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

247
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,041
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

248
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,416
<i>Do you know what my father</i>
<i>will do if I fail?</i>

249
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,958
<i>But what will you achieve</i>
<i>by copying in the exam?</i>

250
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,083
<i>Copying is wrong. My grandfather says</i>
<i>it's as bad as cheating someone.</i>

251
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,000
<i>Really? You know what</i>
<i>my grandfather told me?</i>

252
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,250
<i>To hit you the same</i>
<i>number of times the teacher hit us.</i>

253
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,083
<i>Oh all right, your wish.</i>

254
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,208
<i>But don't hit too hard.</i>

255
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,375
<i>You think we were growing flowers in our</i>
<i>hands when he hit us? Show me your palm</i>

256
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,083
<i>- How many times did he hit you, Chenulu?</i>
<i>- Three times.</i>

257
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,916
<i>He hit me five times. Two extra</i>
<i>for showing you my paper.</i>

258
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,250
<i>So eight times in total.</i>

259
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,333
<i>Ah!</i>

260
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,791
<i>Ouch!</i>

261
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,541
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

262
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,541
<i>Will you dare get us caught again?</i>

263
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,958
<i>- Are we even?</i>
<i>- Yes, we are.</i>

264
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,875
<i>All right. Now go home and study.</i>

265
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,333
<i>If you copy again tomorrow, I won't be</i>
<i>able to stop myself from reporting you.</i>

266
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,166
<i>What! What is wrong with her?</i>

267
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,958
<i>You know, when Gandhiji was a student,</i>

268
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,416
<i>he did not copy even</i>
<i>when the teacher asked him to.</i>

269
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
<i>- Gandhi...</i>
<i>- Sister! Please stop.</i>

270
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,708
<i>You and your Gandhiji.</i>

271
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,541
<i>You know your Gandhiji roamed</i>
<i>with two young girls?</i>

272
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,208
<i>He also delayed our country's</i>
<i>independence, apparently.</i>

273
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,958
<i>We would have gotten it much earlier.</i>

274
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,625
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
<i>- You're both lying to me. I'm leaving.</i>

275
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,083
<i>We told you the truth. Ask anyone.</i>

276
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,583
<i>Fine. I'll go ask my Grandpa</i>
<i>if you guys are lying.</i>

277
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>Sure. Ask him.</i>

278
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,500
<i>I've never understood what's the matter with her.</i>

279
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,458
<i>Crazy girl! She assumes to know all </i>
<i>but knows nothing. </i>

280
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,416
<i>How will she survive in this world?</i>

281
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,750
<i>What's wrong, Grandpa?</i>

282
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,458
<i>Why? Do I not look fine?</i>

283
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,750
<i>You're not happy. You look serious.</i>

284
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,000
<i>It's nothing, dear. The village is going</i>
<i>through a small crisis.</i>

285
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,750
<i>What happened?</i>

286
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,708
<i>Let it be, dear.</i>
<i>You're too young to understand.</i>

287
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,750
<i>Don't be sad. I don't like it.</i>

288
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,916
<i>You should always smile, like me.</i>

289
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,875
<i>Then paste your smile onto my face.</i>

290
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,666
<i>Look! It's stuck so well.</i>

291
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,291
<i>I am not able to stop smiling!</i>

292
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,541
<i>That's more like it.</i>

293
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,958
<i>Did you write your exam well?</i>

294
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,375
<i>I did.</i>

295
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,541
<i>What is it, dear?</i>

296
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,791
<i>Chenulu and Mallesh copied in the exam.</i>

297
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,833
<i>So, I reported them to the teacher.</i>

298
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,666
<i>The teacher hit them really hardâ€¦</i>

299
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,208
<i>and then they hit me.</i>

300
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,041
<i>What? They hit you?</i>
<i>Let me talk to them.</i>

301
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,291
<i>Let it be, Grandpa.</i>
<i>Why do you want to get involved?</i>

302
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,958
<i>We kids have our own issues. Let them be.</i>

303
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,791
<i>They're already angry with me.</i>

304
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,541
<i>They even said bad things about Gandhiji.</i>

305
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,916
<i>What did they say about Gandhiji?</i>

306
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,458
<i>That Gandhiji apparently used to roam</i>
<i>around with two girls.</i>

307
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,000
<i>They said he was not a good man.</i>

308
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,875
<i>Gandhiji was an old man, right?</i>

309
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,458
<i>To help him sit, make him stand and hold</i>

310
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,375
<i>there used to be two women</i>
<i>with him all the time.</i>

311
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,458
<i>That's all.</i>

312
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,333
<i>When you meet your friends tomorrow,</i>
<i>tell them this.</i>

313
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,458
<i>They also said our independence</i>
<i>got delayed because of Gandhiji.</i>

314
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,125
<i>Is that true?</i>

315
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:17,458
<i>Gandhiji went to jail.</i>
<i>He was beaten a lot.</i>

316
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,041
<i>He stayed hungry.</i>

317
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,416
<i>He suffered, but he never blamed anyone.</i>

318
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:26,666
<i>It doesn't take much time</i>
<i>to win using violence.</i>

319
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,375
<i>But if you want to win with love,</i>

320
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,750
<i>that takes a lot of time.</i>

321
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,375
<i>I'll go get Chenulu and Mallesh...</i>

322
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,916
<i>- would you tell them this too?</i>
<i>- Of course! I will tell them''</i>

323
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,083
<i>Come. Let us leave.</i>

324
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,583
<i>Oh! Pick that up, dear.</i>

325
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,250
<i>When you picked it up, you dusted it,</i>
<i>right?</i>

326
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,333
<i>Do the same with everything in life.</i>

327
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,166
<i>Dust off the bad. Keep the good.</i>

328
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,083
<i>All right! Here's your money.</i>

329
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,125
<i>Keep it. Buy some</i>
<i>sesame laddus for yourself.</i>

330
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,708
<i>When Suri comes...</i>

331
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,791
<i>you drag his leg and pull him down.</i>

332
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,833
<i>Then we'll all pounce on him.</i>

333
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,666
<i>Won't he get hurt, Mallesh?</i>

334
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,416
<i>I'll smack your face right now.</i>
<i>Of course, he'll get hurt.</i>

335
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,833
<i>If you don't want to play,</i>
<i>find a corner and sit quietly.</i>

336
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,541
<i>Okay, okay. I'll play.</i>

337
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,833
<i>Bro, she'll make us lose.</i>

338
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,208
<i>Kabaddi... Kabaddi...</i>

339
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,416
<i>Kabaddi... Kabaddi...</i>

340
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:44,583
<i>Kabaddi... Kabaddi...</i>

341
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,583
<i>- Kabaddi... Kabaddi...</i>
<i>- Sorry, sorry, sorryâ€¦</i>

342
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,583
<i>Sorry... Sorry... Sorry.</i>

343
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,500
<i>She is a mental case.</i>

344
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,875
<i>Are you mad?</i>
<i>Why are you saying sorry? Go sit.</i>

345
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,916
<i>- You're not playing, go sit.</i>
<i>- No, no. I want to play. Please, Chenulu.</i>

346
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,208
<i>It's useless to argue with her.</i>

347
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,875
<i>This time, send her in.</i>

348
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,125
<i>She'll get out quicklyâ€¦</i>

349
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,500
<i>And then we can play in peace.</i>

350
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,958
<i>All right. Gandhi, this time you go!</i>

351
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,625
<i>- Me?</i>
<i>- Hmm.</i>

352
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,750
<i>Kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddiâ€¦</i>

353
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,125
<i>Ah! Maâ€¦</i>

354
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,666
<i>Why is she screaming like this?</i>

355
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,875
<i>I don't know. I'm getting scared.</i>
<i>I'll go get someone.</i>

356
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,958
<i>Go.</i>

357
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:50,916
<i>Gandhiâ€¦</i>

358
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>Gandhi!</i>

359
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,416
<i>Father-in-law, Gandhi got periods</i>

360
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,000
<i>Good to hear that, dear.</i>

361
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:10,958
<i>Gandhi?</i>

362
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,583
<i>Are you fine or still in pain?</i>

363
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,833
<i>My stomach hurts a lot, Grandpa.</i>

364
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,875
<i>There will be pain. You have to bear it.</i>

365
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,708
<i>Why are you talking like that, dear?</i>

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,958
<i>The child is in pain.</i>

367
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,416
<i>Give her some fenugreek seeds,</i>
<i>it'll help ease the pain.</i>

368
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,208
<i>All right.</i>

369
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,625
<i>Hold out your hand.</i>

370
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,500
<i>Don't touch anyone for a while.</i>

371
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,291
<i>- Why?</i>
<i>- When should we have her ceremony?</i>

372
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,500
<i>In 13 days. I'll invite my parents too.</i>

373
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,916
<i>They'll want to gift her a few things.</i>

374
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,791
<i>We'll set up a tent and arrange a</i>
<i>feast. Let's call everyone.</i>

375
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,500
<i>Why all the fuss, father?</i>

376
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,291
<i>What do you mean why, dear?</i>
<i>It's all for you.</i>

377
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,916
<i>You've become a big girl.</i>
<i>We must celebrate it.</i>

378
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,375
<i>So now, you'll invite everyoneâ€¦</i>

379
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,875
<i>serve them lunch...</i>

380
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,916
<i>and announce that I've become a big girl?</i>

381
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,291
<i>I don't want all this.</i>
<i>I want to sit at home.</i>

382
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,250
<i>Grandpa, tell them not to!</i>

383
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,166
<i>Even when we want to do</i>
<i>something for you, you cry!</i>

384
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,916
<i>Always crying and complaining.</i>
<i>What kind of a girl are you?</i>

385
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,000
<i>What, child? What happened?</i>

386
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,041
<i>Grandpa, I don't want a ceremony.</i>

387
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,750
<i>Tell them. They won't listen to me.</i>

388
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,708
<i>Is a ceremony necessary, Yadamma?</i>

389
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,208
<i>The child is already in pain.</i>

390
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,375
<i>Every girl in the world gets her period.</i>

391
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,875
<i>What's there to celebrate about it?</i>

392
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,458
<i>How would it matter if we</i>
<i>don't have the ceremony?</i>

393
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,166
<i>We fall for the empty promises of men</i>

394
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,541
<i>Why do they always cheat us, Rajamma?</i>

395
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:27,208
<i>Have we women ever been given...</i>

396
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,875
<i>true freedom, sister?</i>

397
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,458
<i>We fall for the empty promises of men</i>

398
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:35,083
<i>Why do they always cheat us, Rajamma?</i>

399
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,708
<i>The preachings of a man are the same</i>

400
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:40,541
<i>as writings on water, sister</i>

401
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,000
<i>When they see Rani Rudramadevi</i>

402
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,541
<i>our men clap for her so loudly</i>

403
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,375
<i>But if we act brave with the men outside</i>

404
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,916
<i>we get thrashings from our man</i>

405
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,333
<i>"Look, our District Collector is a woman"</i>

406
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,083
<i>Our village men praise her</i>

407
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:22,875
<i>These same men get us married,</i>
<i>the moment we pass tenth grade</i>

408
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,666
<i>"We fall for their sweet praises</i>
<i>and become fools, Rajamma."</i>

409
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:34,000
<i>"Are we being punished for our naivety, </i>
<i>a perennial penance draped in our femininity?"</i>

410
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,291
<i>"We fall for their sweet praises </i>
<i>and become fools, Rajamma."</i>

411
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:44,666
<i>"Are we being punished for our naivety, </i>
<i>a perennial penance draped in our femininity?"</i>

412
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,250
<i>Hello, sir...</i>

413
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:03,583
<i>Hello...</i>

414
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:04,833
<i>Am I audible, sir?</i>

415
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,625
<i>Sir, it's me... Ellayya, the Sarpanch of Adluru.</i>

416
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,333
<i>Yes, Ellayya... What's the matter?</i>

417
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,541
<i>Sir, we are facing grave trouble. </i>

418
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,958
<i>The sugar factory owners are not buying our sugarcane. </i>
<i>They have sent back our vehicles.</i>

419
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,125
<i>We are heavily distressed. </i>
<i>Can you please help us out?</i>

420
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,500
<i>Ellayya, the government has already taken </i>
<i>the decision, we can't do anything now. </i>

421
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,875
<i>Now we can't change it for</i>
<i>your one village, can we?</i>

422
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,375
<i>How can you say that, sir?</i>

423
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,125
<i>The whole village is distressed.</i>

424
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,958
<i>Everyone has huge debts on them.</i>

425
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,958
<i>Don't talk like this, sir. </i>
<i>Please help us out.</i>

426
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:38,666
<i>Call me after a week.</i>
<i>Let me think about it.</i>

427
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,583
<i>We'll find some solution.</i>

428
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,458
<i>Sir, please don't say that. </i>
<i>You are our only hope.</i>

429
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,583
<i>Call me after a week.</i>

430
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,083
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

431
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:50,791
<i>Satish...</i>

432
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,291
<i>Sir...</i>

433
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,291
<i>Visit Adluru next week.</i>

434
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,291
<i>Sure, sir.</i>

435
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,625
<i>Gandhi! Are you coming or should we leave?</i>

436
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,416
<i>Yes! Wait a minute. I'm coming.</i>

437
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:08,666
<i>Gandhi, stop.</i>

438
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:14,791
<i>Why are you going with them?</i>
<i>Do you not have any shame?</i>

439
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:18,333
<i>You just became a big girl.</i>
<i>You can't mix with boys from now on.</i>

440
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:21,625
<i>- What will the villagers think?</i>
<i>- Ma, what are you saying?</i>

441
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,958
<i>I've been going to school with</i>
<i>them since forever.</i>

442
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,708
<i>What has changed now that I shouldn't?</i>

443
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,583
<i>I can't explain everything to you.</i>
<i>Just listen to me and don't go.</i>

444
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,208
<i>Boys! Leave! From today,</i>
<i>she won't walk to school with you.</i>

445
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:35,791
<i>Okay.</i>

446
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,625
<i>I'll ask your father to drop you.</i>

447
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,291
<i>Ma, don't you trust me?</i>

448
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,458
<i>- I do, dear. But the villagers...</i>
<i>- Forget the villagers.</i>

449
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,041
<i>You know they're my childhood</i>
<i>friends, right?</i>

450
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,041
<i>We have never done anything wrong.</i>

451
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,208
<i>So why punish us?</i>

452
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,166
<i>All right. Go!</i>

453
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,041
<i>I have complete trust in you. Go.</i>

454
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,916
<i>I don't know how she is going to live.</i>

455
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,541
<i>Guys wait.</i>

456
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,416
<i>What happened? </i>
<i>Why did your grandmother drive us out?</i>

457
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,625
<i>Are we not meeting each other henceforth?</i>

458
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,916
<i>What are you talking about? </i>

459
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,708
<i>We met now, didn't we? </i>
<i>Come, let's go. Come.</i>

460
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,041
<i>Hey, Gandhi. I heard you've come of age</i>
<i>and there was a function to celebrate that.</i>

461
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,958
<i>Why didn't you call me?</i>

462
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,416
<i>What nonsense are you talking about?</i>

463
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:40,083
<i>Don't worry, when you hit puberty,</i>
<i>I'll arrange a function for you too. Idiot!</i>

464
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,416
<i>It's okay. Leave.</i>
<i>Come.</i>

465
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,333
<i>You all know the sugar factory</i>
<i>is shutting down.</i>

466
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:27,041
<i>You all planted sugarcane, but the</i>
<i>factory is not in a position to buy it.</i>

467
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,875
<i>Certainly you will all lose your money.</i>

468
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,750
<i>Sir, do you have any solution?</i>

469
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:34,916
<i>I most certainly do.</i>

470
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,875
<i>After you've lost everything...</i>

471
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:40,041
<i>where will you get the money</i>
<i>to plant new crop?</i>

472
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,708
<i>That is why, to save and support</i>
<i>all of you...</i>

473
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,291
<i>our KTC company is planning to</i>
<i>set up a factory.</i>

474
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,708
<i>KTC... What factory is this, sir?</i>

475
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,541
<i>A chemical factory.</i>

476
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,625
<i>What? A chemical factory?</i>

477
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,166
<i>Yes.</i>

478
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,541
<i>A factory for your village!</i>

479
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,041
<i>Give us 150 acres.</i>

480
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:04,083
<i>Sell us your lands and we</i>
<i>will build a factory for you.</i>

481
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,041
<i>What will become of us?</i>

482
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:08,583
<i>I know exactly what you're all thinking.</i>

483
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:13,041
<i>If this factory comes,</i>
<i>imagine how your village will flourish!</i>

484
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,416
<i>We will give you jobs.</i>

485
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,958
<i>Tomorrow, you children will</i>
<i>also have jobs.</i>

486
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,458
<i>We'll build a hospital. We'll lay roads.</i>

487
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,375
<i>We'll even build houses for all of you.</i>

488
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,708
<i>We will help you through every difficulty.</i>

489
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:32,125
<i>This factory will be with you and</i>
<i>for you at all times.</i>

490
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:35,083
<i>If you build this factory,</i>
<i>won't our village be destroyed?</i>

491
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,125
<i>I want to uplift your village</i>
<i>and he's talking about damage.</i>

492
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,416
<i>I have come to help you.</i>

493
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,583
<i>In such times, what is more important?</i>
<i>Your lands or your lives?</i>

494
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,166
<i>Think carefully.</i>

495
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,333
<i>One more thing.</i>

496
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,166
<i>You have two weeks to come to a decision.</i>

497
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:03,166
<i>The minister told me you're all desperate</i>
<i>and in dire need of money.</i>

498
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,250
<i>So I came here.</i>

499
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:06,958
<i>Else, I would have gone to</i>
<i>another village.</i>

500
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,708
<i>Go home and think carefully.</i>

501
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:16,000
<i>He is offering five lakh rupees per acre.</i>

502
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,958
<i>Lands in this area don't even go for three</i>
<i>lakh rupees. Better for us to sell.</i>

503
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:24,166
<i>Yes, brother! Even I'm thinking of selling</i>
<i>and moving to the city.</i>

504
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,958
<i>we planted Sugarcane.</i>
<i>The factory is not buying</i>

505
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,250
<i>what do we do?</i>

506
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,666
<i>You get sugar cane juice right?</i>

507
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,750
<i>All of you take out sugar cane juice and</i>
<i>drink it.</i>

508
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:37,750
<i>We have been thinking all this time.</i>

509
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,958
<i>I have also been thinking the same way.</i>
<i>I will along with you.</i>

510
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,583
<i>Lakshmi, can you loan me two hundred</i>
<i>rupees? I'll pay you back next month.</i>

511
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:54,083
<i>I don't have money, sister. I haven't even</i>
<i>paid my daughter's school fees.</i>

512
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,125
<i>We are living a life of compromise.</i>

513
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,583
<i>We don't even have the money</i>
<i>to buy groceries.</i>

514
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,666
<i>- Suri!</i>
<i>- Greetings, sir.</i>

515
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,333
<i>- How's it going with you?</i>
<i>- Nothing to speak of, sir..</i>

516
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:27,166
<i>I am moving to the city next week.</i>
<i>I'll work there as a handyman.</i>

517
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:30,625
<i>Who will take care of your fields</i>
<i>if you go there and work as a handyman?</i>

518
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:34,666
<i>Uh, I don't know how to tell you this.</i>
<i>I'm planning to sell my fields, sir.</i>

519
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,833
<i>You want to sell your fields? What will</i>
<i>you do after selling your fields?</i>

520
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,166
<i>I had taken a loan for my</i>
<i>daughter's wedding.</i>

521
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,000
<i>Once I repay that, I'll feel much lighter.</i>

522
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:47,041
<i>I'll save the remaining money</i>
<i>and work in the city as a handyman.</i>

523
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,500
<i>I'll come back once</i>
<i>the factory is set up, sir.</i>

524
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,958
<i>Who are you selling your fields to?</i>

525
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,500
<i>The same gentleman from the city</i>
<i>who came the other day.</i>

526
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,000
<i>I plan on selling to him.</i>

527
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,958
<i>Are you out of your mind, Suri?</i>

528
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,125
<i>If you all care only about yourselves,</i>
<i>what will happen to the village?</i>

529
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,541
<i>Why are you scolding me</i>
<i>as if I'm the only one going, sir?</i>

530
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,666
<i>Villagers are planning to sell</i>
<i>their fields.</i>

531
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,166
<i>Also, everyone is in a bad situation.</i>

532
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,833
<i>You tell him. You're selling your land,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

533
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:17,583
<i>Yes sir.</i>
<i>The situation at home is very bad.</i>

534
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:20,416
<i>So? If conditions are bad, will you sell</i>
<i>the village itself?</i>

535
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,333
<i>Then, you give us money, sir.</i>
<i>Everyone's problems will be solved.</i>

536
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,583
<i>Everyone comes forward to advise.</i>

537
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:28,458
<i>But no one comes to help.</i>

538
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,541
<i>We are almost done.</i>

539
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,541
<i>There is still this 15-acre property near</i>
<i>the main road.</i>

540
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,541
<i>Who owns it? They didn't come.</i>

541
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,000
<i>An old man.</i>

542
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,583
<i>He is very stubborn.</i>
<i>He won't sell his land, sir.</i>

543
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:31,333
<i>He won't sell? How can he not?</i>

544
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,875
<i>If he doesn't sell his land, we won't be</i>
<i>able to lay the road.</i>

545
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,708
<i>Go and talk to him.</i>

546
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,375
<i>He's very stubborn, sir.</i>
<i>Even if I talk to him, he won't listen.</i>

547
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,791
<i>It's better if you talk to him.</i>

548
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:44,500
<i>Fine. I'll go talk to him.</i>

549
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:45,750
<i>Where does he stay?</i>

550
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,041
<i>There's a field back there.</i>

551
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,916
<i>There's a huge tree in the middle.</i>
<i>He'll be sitting underneath it.</i>

552
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,791
<i>Bring the car.</i>

553
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,541
<i>Sir, vehicles can't go there.</i>

554
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:55,958
<i>Then how will we get there?</i>

555
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,250
<i>Excuse me.</i>

556
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,875
<i>Are you Ramachandrayya?</i>

557
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,416
<i>Yes.</i>

558
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:20,833
<i>Please sit.</i>

559
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,916
<i>I knew you would create a nuisance.</i>

560
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:32,583
<i>I have not created any nuisance. </i>

561
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,333
<i>In fact, you came here with the wrong intention, </i>
<i>to destroy our village.</i>

562
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,125
<i>I'm just doing the right thing.</i>

563
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,625
<i>My father worked for the Britishers.</i>

564
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,375
<i>Later, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi,</i>

565
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,916
<i>he quit his job and became a freedom fighter.</i>

566
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:57,166
<i>Speaking English won't make us great, son.</i>

567
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,875
<i>What makes a man great are his ideals</i>
<i>and his dedication towards them.</i>

568
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:13,041
<i>Hey, why are you scaring him?</i>
<i>I'm talking to him, have some patience.</i>

569
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,166
<i>I'll come to the point.</i>

570
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,666
<i>It seems you don't wish to sell your land.</i>

571
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,541
<i>If you don't sell, how will we lay</i>
<i>our road?</i>

572
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,541
<i>So if I don't sell my land,</i>
<i>you have no other option?</i>

573
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,250
<i>Tell me how much you want.</i>
<i>I'll try and get you the best price.</i>

574
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:39,750
<i>What is your name, son?</i>

575
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:41,541
<i>Satish.</i>

576
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,875
<i>Satish?</i>

577
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,416
<i>if I sell you this land,</i>
<i>will you cut this tree?</i>

578
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,583
<i>Of course! If we are to build our road,</i>
<i>we have to take down the tree.</i>

579
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,375
<i>Have you ever heard of the</i>
<i>Thotaramudu story?</i>

580
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,708
<i>Yeah. Long ago.</i>

581
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,083
<i>Why bring it up now?</i>

582
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,166
<i>Just like Thotaramudu,</i>
<i>whose life was stuck in a parrot...</i>

583
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,791
<i>my life is stuck in this tree.</i>

584
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,125
<i>What? In this tree?</i>

585
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,291
<i>Okay. So what are you trying to say?</i>

586
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,333
<i>If you cut down this tree,</i>
<i>I will lose my life.</i>

587
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:20,041
<i>If I know I'm going to lose my life,</i>
<i>why would I sell my land to you?</i>

588
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,583
<i>Buy another land with a</i>
<i>similar tree in it.</i>

589
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,708
<i>Won't you find</i>
<i>such a tree elsewhere?</i>

590
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,208
<i>This is too much.</i>

591
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,625
<i>When Gandhiji died,</i>

592
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,791
<i>my father and I planted this tree in</i>
<i>his remembrance.</i>

593
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,875
<i>Sentiment. Very nice.</i>

594
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,083
<i>You must be around 30?</i>

595
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,125
<i>I am 32.</i>

596
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,666
<i>How many trees have you</i>
<i>planted in all your life?</i>

597
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,791
<i>My balcony is full of money plants.</i>

598
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,208
<i>Some 10-15 plants easily.</i>

599
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,791
<i>Will they provide enough oxygen</i>
<i>to you for your entire life?</i>

600
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,500
<i>I have planted lakhs of trees in</i>
<i>my lifetime.</i>

601
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:00,750
<i>You are alive because of trees</i>
<i>planted by someone else.</i>

602
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,208
<i>Actually, you have no right over the air</i>
<i>you are breathing.</i>

603
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,000
<i>Do you know that?</i>

604
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,750
<i>So?</i>

605
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,708
<i>So what right do you have to cut</i>
<i>this tree?</i>

606
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,791
<i>Forget an axe. I won't let you even</i>
<i>lay your finger on this tree.</i>

607
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,291
<i>I won't sell my land, son. You can leave.</i>

608
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,416
<i>Okay.</i>

609
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,500
<i>I'll leave. Let's talk peacefully later.</i>

610
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,958
<i>That won't be needed, son.</i>
<i>Leave. Take care.</i>

611
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
<i>Tough guy.</i>

612
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,541
<i>I won't let anything happen to you.</i>

613
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,500
<i>I'm here. I'll take care of you.</i>

614
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,791
<i>All right?</i>

615
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,791
<i>Well, brother? I hear you're not selling</i>
<i>your land?</i>

616
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,791
<i>My father won't budge.</i>

617
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:07,291
<i>Everyone in the village has sold</i>
<i>their land. Except you.</i>

618
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:10,000
<i>They're saying they won't start</i>
<i>construction unless you sell.</i>

619
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:12,500
<i>Everyone is speaking ill about you</i>
<i>and your family.</i>

620
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,583
<i>My father is stubborn.</i>
<i>He won't listen to me.</i>

621
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,041
<i>Then be firm with him.</i>
<i>Are you still a child?</i>

622
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,916
<i>If you don't need money, fine.</i>
<i>But, think about the others.</i>

623
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,291
<i>Everyone in the village is in debt.</i>

624
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,083
<i>Has Gandhi eaten?</i>

625
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,791
<i>Yes, she has.</i>

626
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,750
<i>Father, I need to speak with you.</i>

627
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,458
<i>Tell me.</i>

628
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:49,583
<i>Father...</i>

629
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,000
<i>Everyone in the village is angry</i>
<i>that we haven't sold our land.</i>

630
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,708
<i>Our land is near the road.</i>

631
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,625
<i>They'll give us a good rate!</i>

632
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,125
<i>If we want, we can ask for more.</i>

633
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,083
<i>How can you even think</i>
<i>such a thought, son?</i>

634
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,166
<i>Did you buy this land?</i>

635
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,666
<i>My father gave me this land.</i>

636
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,333
<i>I must protect it. Not sell it.</i>

637
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,416
<i>Father, we are not getting good yield.</i>

638
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,250
<i>Even if we do, we do not get a good price.</i>

639
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,958
<i>When they'll close the sugar factory,</i>
<i>we'll be out of options.</i>

640
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,875
<i>When it doesn't bring us earnings,</i>
<i>why do you want to keep the land?</i>

641
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,500
<i>I'll move to the city and work.</i>

642
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,041
<i>Stop blabbering.</i>

643
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,958
<i>Says he wants to sell the land.</i>

644
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,208
<i>It's wrong, son.</i>

645
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,708
<i>To sell the land that feeds us...</i>

646
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,958
<i>is like making your mother a prostitute.</i>

647
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,875
<i>My mother lived a miserable life</i>
<i>because of you.</i>

648
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,041
<i>She lived an unhappy life.</i>

649
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,333
<i>Do you want my family</i>
<i>to go through the same pain?</i>

650
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:49,875
<i>Do you not want any of us to be happy?</i>

651
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,666
<i>There is no happiness in city life, son.</i>

652
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,416
<i>Here, we live like kings.</i>

653
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,500
<i>When you can't</i>
<i>protect the land under your feet,</i>

654
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,625
<i>do you think you will fly in the city?</i>

655
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:05,625
<i>Whether you sell or not,</i>
<i>I'm leaving this village.</i>

656
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,541
<i>I'll take a loan and</i>
<i>leave, if I have to.</i>

657
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:12,208
<i>Also, that land is my grandfather's</i>
<i>property. It's my inheritance, not yours.</i>

658
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:17,041
<i>Why are you speaking to your father like</i>
<i>that? Give him some respect.</i>

659
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:22,708
<i>I am also 40 years old. It will be</i>
<i>better for him to give respect to me.</i>

660
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,583
<i>No matter what you say.</i>

661
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,416
<i>As long as I live,</i>
<i>I am not selling the land.</i>

662
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:32,125
<i>Then please die!</i>

663
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,875
<i>I'll sell the land.</i>

664
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,666
<i>At least we will be happy.</i>

665
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:39,291
<i>Have you gone mad?</i>

666
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,333
<i>How can you talk to your father like that?</i>

667
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,791
<i>Father-in-law, please don't get up.</i>

668
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,541
<i>It's okay, dear.</i>

669
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,208
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

670
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,625
<i>"At the stroke of the midnight hour</i>

671
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,916
<i>when the world sleeps."</i>

672
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:41,291
<i>"India will awake to</i>

673
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,875
<i>light and freedom!"</i>

674
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,791
<i>What is Nehru saying, sir?</i>

675
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,625
<i>Tell us, sir.</i>

676
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,541
<i>Nehru says we have got our independence!</i>

677
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,125
<i>What does that mean, father?</i>

678
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:39,041
<i>Today, good triumphed over evil, son.</i>
<i>We are free now.</i>

679
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:49,625
<i>"Eashwar, Allah, all your divine names..."</i>

680
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:53,541
<i>"Grant us wisdom and harmony, O Lord."</i>

681
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:57,750
<i>"Grant us companionship, O Lord."</i>

682
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:01,791
<i>No, no. Not Sangati. It's 'Sanmati'.</i>

683
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,875
<i>- Sanmati.</i>
<i>- San-mati.</i>

684
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:09,791
<i>Sanmati means,''Give us all good thoughts</i>
<i>O God''</i>

685
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,916
<i>Who is praying to whom, father?</i>

686
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,625
<i>Our Gandhiji, son.</i>

687
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:18,250
<i>Jesus, Allah and Ram. He's praying that</i>
<i>they bless us with purity of thought!</i>

688
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,916
<i>Why is Gandhiji praying for that, father?</i>

689
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,958
<i>If everyone had pure thoughts,</i>

690
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:26,958
<i>even the biggest battles would be</i>
<i>resolved peacefully!</i>

691
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,000
<i>If someone were to hit you on your face,</i>

692
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:31,750
<i>we must turn our other cheek to them.</i>

693
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:34,500
<i>If we turn the other cheek,</i>
<i>they'll hit us again, father.</i>

694
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:35,833
<i>Yes, they will.</i>

695
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,791
<i>But soon they'll get tired of hitting you.</i>

696
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,833
<i>Tired, they'll leave, and let you be.</i>

697
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:44,000
<i>Our Gandhiji brought us Independence</i>
<i>the same way, son.</i>

698
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,416
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

699
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,041
<i>Walk carefully, son. You'll fall.</i>

700
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,708
<i>Nothing will happen. You're there for me.</i>

701
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,791
<i>Mahatma Gandhi is dead.</i>

702
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:01,000
<i>The funeral procession across the land,</i>
<i>now plunged into grief.</i>

703
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,083
<i>Why are you crying, son?</i>

704
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:15,958
<i>Gandhiji passed away, father.</i>

705
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,041
<i>They just announced it on the radio.</i>

706
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:21,750
<i>Why did he leave before</i>
<i>I could meet him?</i>

707
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,708
<i>It's okay if you couldn't meet Bapu.</i>

708
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:26,750
<i>Because Bapu is always</i>
<i>looking at you from above.</i>

709
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,166
<i>Wipe your tears, son.</i>
<i>Wipe your tears.</i>

710
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,166
<i>Now that Gandhiji has passed,</i>

711
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,291
<i>everyone will forget him. Won't they?</i>

712
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,375
<i>How can they forget him, son?</i>

713
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,000
<i>They call him 'Father of the Nation'.</i>

714
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:44,833
<i>Will you ever forget me, your father?</i>

715
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,166
<i>How could I forget you, father?</i>

716
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:52,416
<i>Exactly, he's the father of our</i>
<i>entire nation.</i>

717
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,083
<i>How could we forget him?</i>

718
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,916
<i>Let's do something to honor our Bapu.</i>

719
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,291
<i>Come with me.</i>

720
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:04,875
<i>If I plant this tree, will I always</i>
<i>remember Bapu, father?</i>

721
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,041
<i>If you plant this tree, it'll grow big...</i>

722
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,708
<i>It will provide pleasant shade,</i>

723
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,625
<i>a cool breeze,</i>

724
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:13,250
<i>and look after everyone.</i>

725
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:16,083
<i>You're planting this tree with such</i>
<i>pure intentions,</i>

726
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,791
<i>Bapu will be proud of you.</i>

727
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:21,875
<i>For caring about the</i>
<i>people of this village.</i>

728
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,166
<i>Bapu will always be with you.</i>

729
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,625
<i>Sow the seed, son.</i>

730
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:26,916
<i>All right.</i>

731
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:33,500
<i>Take great care of this sapling.</i>

732
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,000
<i>Yes, father.</i>

733
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,416
<i>As long as this grows,</i>
<i>Bapu will always be with you.</i>

734
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,500
<i>- Understood, son?</i>
<i>- Yes, father.</i>

735
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,083
<i>What's it, Grandpa?</i>
<i>You're still here?</i>

736
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,416
<i>Come, let's go home.</i>

737
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,000
<i>Come here, child. Sit with me.</i>

738
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:28,791
<i>What happened, Grandpa?</i>

739
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,333
<i>Are you all right? Have you eaten?</i>

740
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:35,625
<i>My sweet Gandhi.</i>

741
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,791
<i>Always thinking about others' happiness.</i>

742
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,333
<i>Stay blessed, child.</i>

743
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:46,666
<i>You stay blessed too, my sweet Grandpa!</i>

744
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,041
<i>Come. Let's go home.</i>

745
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,125
<i>Dear,</i>

746
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,958
<i>I taught you 'Raghupati</i>
<i>Raghava Raja Ram', did I not?</i>

747
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,125
<i>Do you still remember the song?</i>

748
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,333
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

749
00:48:57,416 --> 00:49:00,083
<i>I even got the first prize</i>
<i>when I sang it in fifth grade.</i>

750
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,708
<i>Will you sing the song for me, once?</i>

751
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:04,833
<i>Now?</i>

752
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:06,833
<i>Yes. Now.</i>

753
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:11,666
<i>Scion of the clan of Raghu</i>

754
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,791
<i>Lord Raam</i>

<i>All your divine names</i>

759

<i>Grant us wisdom and Harmony</i>

760

<i>O Lord</i>

761
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:35,083
<i>Do you remember the meaning of the song?</i>

762
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:38,583
<i>Ram, Eashwar, and Allah.</i>
<i>They are all one.</i>

763
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:42,333
<i>We pray to God</i>
<i>to bless everyone with pure thoughts.</i>

764
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:46,541
<i>Yes, we should pray to God.</i>

765
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,041
<i>You have to promise me something, child.</i>

766
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,125
<i>Will you?</i>

767
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:54,208
<i>Tell me. What do you want me</i>
<i>to promise you?</i>

768
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,833
<i>Will you protect my tree at all costs?</i>

769
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,625
<i>Okay. I'll protect it.</i>

770
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,375
<i>Promise?</i>

771
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,750
<i>I promise you, Grandpa.</i>

772
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:08,125
<i>Nothing will ever happen to your tree.</i>

773
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,500
<i>Now let's go home. I'm hungry.</i>

774
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,083
<i>I'm very tired, child.</i>

775
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,375
<i>You go on, I'll be along.</i>

776
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,958
<i>Come fast. I won't eat if</i>
<i>you're not there.</i>

777
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,250
<i>You eat, dear. I'll come in a while.</i>

778
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:52,166
<i>The old man doesn't want to sell.</i>
<i>Why are you tormenting him?</i>

779
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,958
<i>Let him have it as long as he's around.</i>

780
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,375
<i>Sell the land after.</i>

781
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:58,458
<i>We have no money! We need to save up for</i>
<i>our daughter's wedding.</i>

782
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:01,875
<i>If I sit around and do nothing,</i>
<i>where will we get money from?</i>

783
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,666
<i>I'm still healthy enough to work and</i>
<i>earn some money. Is that wrong?</i>

784
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:16,750
<i>What, dear? What are you doing here?</i>

785
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,541
<i>Where's Grandpa?</i>

786
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,416
<i>Grandpa said he'll come soon.</i>

787
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:23,416
<i>Okay. Come inside and eat.</i>

788
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,750
<i>No. I won't eat until Grandpa comes.</i>

789
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,791
<i>He's never this late.</i>

790
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,333
<i>I'll go get him.</i>

791
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:32,500
<i>No, you won't.</i>

792
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,416
<i>I'll send your father. Wait.</i>

793
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
<i>What happened?</i>

794
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:38,500
<i>Your father hasnâ€™t come back.</i>

795
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,166
<i>Will you go check where he is?</i>

796
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,833
<i>He'll come back home, don't worry.</i>

797
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:44,833
<i>It's not that. He's never this late!</i>

798
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:47,500
<i>Go check on him, once.</i>
<i>Listen to me, please.</i>

799
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,208
<i>- Gandhi wants to go alone.</i>
<i>- Alright. I'll go.</i>

800
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:58,083
<i>Let's go.</i>

801
00:51:58,750 --> 00:51:59,791
<i>Come home quickly.</i>

802
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,250
<i>Look! Grandpa's still sitting there.</i>

803
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:09,958
<i>Grandpa!</i>

804
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,541
<i>Grandpa!</i>

805
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,708
<i>Grandpa! Come, let's go home.</i>

806
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,458
<i>Grandpa.</i>

807
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:28,083
<i>Grandpa.</i>

808
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:29,708
<i>Grandpa.</i>

809
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,375
<i>Rama...</i>

810
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,541
<i>The rays of the sun touch me everyday...</i>

811
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:12,958
<i>But they lack the warmth of your hands.</i>

812
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:18,166
<i>We so many conversations left unfinished.</i>

813
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,541
<i>Come, sleep in my shade.</i>

814
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:27,458
<i>Come ,Sit here.</i>

815
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,333
<i>Complain about your son.</i>

816
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,041
<i>Do come...</i>

817
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,708
<i>Remind your father</i>

818
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,875
<i>Talk about your wife.</i>

819
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,333
<i>Tell me about your granddaughter.</i>

820
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:47,125
<i>If you are happy! You held me and laughed.</i>

821
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:54,125
<i>Vented your pain to me.</i>

822
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,625
<i>Where have you gone, Rama?</i>

823
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,750
<i>Won't you share your</i>
<i>joys and sorrows with me?</i>

824
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,833
<i>My branches ask after you.</i>

825
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:12,583
<i>My roots search for you.</i>

826
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,125
<i>My bark feels heavier than ever.</i>

827
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,583
<i>I wish I had eyes.</i>

828
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,625
<i>I would have cast off</i>
<i>this burden to be with you.</i>

829
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,750
<i>Alasâ€¦</i>

830
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:29,458
<i>Why did you have to weep for me?</i>

831
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:33,250
<i>If I'm gone, there are a hundred trees</i>
<i>like me.</i>

832
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,125
<i>You left the moment God called to you.</i>

833
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:40,000
<i>Do you love God more than me?</i>

834
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:48,541
<i>Without you, these branches and</i>
<i>leaves feel useless.</i>

835
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:51,000
<i>I don't want this life anymore.</i>

836
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,791
<i>You made this decision to leave.</i>

837
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:59,958
<i>Could you not have</i>
<i>taken me with you, Rama?</i>

838
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:06,750
<i>Why, Rama?</i>
<i>Why did you leave me and go?</i>

839
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,375
<i>Rama...</i>

840
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,458
<i>Rama...</i>

841
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,250
<i>Rama...</i>

842
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:29,958
<i>Rama...</i>

843
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:54,083
<i>Diwakar, how are you doing?</i>

844
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,583
<i>I don't know.</i>

845
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,666
<i>I still haven't processed his death.</i>

846
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,833
<i>Your father had a pure heart.</i>

847
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,666
<i>He always wished everyone well.</i>

848
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:06,208
<i>The Gods will look after him</i>
<i>wherever he is.</i>

849
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,833
<i>Are you Ramachandrayya's son?</i>

850
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,416
<i>Yes.</i>

851
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:20,875
<i>Can we step aside,</i>
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

852
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:23,208
<i>Tell me.</i>

853
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,250
<i>Please let's step aside.</i>

854
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,375
<i>You hold a degree. Degree in what?</i>

855
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,333
<i>I am a B.Com graduate, sir.</i>

856
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:37,208
<i>B.Com... B.Com graduate but involved in farming.</i>

857
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,000
<i>What can I do, sir?</i>

858
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,041
<i>Is your job anywhere related to your education?</i>

859
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,666
<i>My father wants me to...</i>

860
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:45,500
<i>How much do you earn every month?</i>

861
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,208
<i>Nothing much, sir.</i>

862
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,458
<i>Then how would you take care of your wife?</i>

863
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,708
<i>Are you understanding what I'm saying?</i>

864
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,541
<i>Listen, I can understand your situation.</i>

865
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,166
<i>I know I shouldn't bring it up</i>
<i>during this time.</i>

866
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,125
<i>This is not your issue alone.</i>

867
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:04,333
<i>- It affects the whole village.</i>
<i>- First tell me what is this about, sir?</i>

868
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,041
<i>Listen.</i>

869
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:09,333
<i>In six months, we are going</i>
<i>to start construction.</i>

870
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,041
<i>I have to complete all the</i>
<i>acquisitions in this month.</i>

871
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:15,958
<i>Everyone in the village peacefully</i>
<i>completed their registration.</i>

872
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,250
<i>Only yours remains.</i>

873
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,708
<i>I am still mourning my father's death.</i>

874
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,666
<i>Listen. I know you have a</i>
<i>one lakh rupee loan.</i>

875
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:25,916
<i>Don't you?</i>

876
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,666
<i>Yeah, I do. So what?</i>

877
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,541
<i>How are you going to repay it?</i>

878
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:33,000
<i>I don't want your money, sir.</i>

879
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:34,916
<i>- I don't want your money.</i>
<i>- Keep this one lakh.</i>

880
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:36,916
<i>Repay your loan.</i>

881
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,333
<i>You'll feel lighter.</i>

882
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:41,208
<i>Now that your father has</i>
<i>passed, consider me your brother.</i>

883
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:47,958
<i>Diwakar.</i>

884
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:50,458
<i>I gave everyone 5 lakh rupees per acre.</i>

885
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,333
<i>I'll give you 6 lakh rupees.</i>

886
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,291
<i>In fact, I'll give you</i>
<i>7 lakh rupees.</i>

887
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,958
<i>Because you're like a brother to me.</i>

888
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,291
<i>Okay.</i>

889
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,416
<i>Even if you don't sell your</i>
<i>land, this one lakh is yours.</i>

890
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,291
<i>Listen.</i>

891
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:13,083
<i>I'll wait for you at</i>
<i>the Village Head's office at 4' o clock.</i>

892
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:14,166
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

893
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,750
<i>But sir...</i>

894
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:25,916
<i>Enough, child.</i>
<i>How much longer will you cry?</i>

895
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:27,625
<i>I don't know, Ma.</i>

896
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,166
<i>I tried to forget Grandpa.</i>

897
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,541
<i>But I'm unable to.</i>

898
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,458
<i>I know, dear.</i>

899
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:39,291
<i>Seeing you cry like this,</i>
<i>I feel bad too.</i>

900
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,375
<i>Yadamma!</i>

901
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:42,458
<i>Look! Your dad's here.</i>

902
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:43,791
<i>Can you fetch me some water?</i>

903
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,833
<i>Look at her.</i>
<i>She's been crying for so long.</i>

904
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,083
<i>Just talk to her.</i>

905
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:04,541
<i>Look what I got you. Take it.</i>

906
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,458
<i>I don't want anything.</i>

907
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,083
<i>Eat it, Child!</i>

908
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:10,791
<i>Take this.</i>

909
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,875
<i>I'm sad too that Grandpa is no more.</i>

910
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,000
<i>After all, he is my father.</i>

911
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,916
<i>But there is nothing we can do.</i>

912
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,333
<i>Life does not stop for anyone.</i>

913
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:35,416
<i>Grandpa adored you.</i>

914
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,750
<i>He showered you with so much love.</i>

915
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:41,958
<i>You should remember</i>
<i>all that love and be happy.</i>

916
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,333
<i>Okay?</i>

917
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:46,708
<i>Here.</i>

918
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,500
<i>I got them for you.</i>

919
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,541
<i>It's been many days</i>
<i>since you had sesame laddus.</i>

920
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,208
<i>Eat, dear. Eat.</i>

921
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:57,541
<i>I see! So...</i>

922
01:00:57,625 --> 01:01:00,750
<i>if your father asks you, you'll eat.</i>
<i>But if your mother asks you, you won't?</i>

923
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:01,875
<i>Is that it?</i>

924
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,458
<i>Obviously!</i>
<i>My daughter will always be on my side.</i>

925
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:06,625
<i>She'll only listen to me.</i>

926
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,416
<i>Nothing like that.</i>

927
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
<i>I'll listen to both of you!</i>

928
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:12,291
<i>I know, dear.</i>

929
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,541
<i>I'm kidding.</i>
<i>I was just teasing your mother.</i>

930
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:17,875
<i>Also, we'll be moving</i>
<i>to the city in three months!</i>

931
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:20,958
<i>I'll admit her in a big private school.</i>

932
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,125
<i>You'll be happy.</i>

933
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:26,416
<i>You'll make lots of friends there.</i>

934
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,750
<i>Okay?</i>

935
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,416
<i>How will we move to the city?</i>

936
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:31,541
<i>Which city? How will we get there?</i>

937
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,291
<i>We don't have the money to move.</i>

938
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:36,416
<i>I have sold our land, Yadamma.</i>

939
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:39,083
<i>Dad...</i>

940
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,000
<i>Those who bought the land...</i>

941
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,875
<i>will they do anything to Grandpa's tree?</i>

942
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,500
<i>Once you've sold them the land,</i>
<i>they can do whatever they want.</i>

943
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:50,291
<i>They can cut the tree or count the store</i>
<i>there. It's their wish.</i>

944
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,208
<i>Once we sell our land,</i>
<i>we don't have any say.</i>

945
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:54,958
<i>Then don't sell.</i>

946
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,291
<i>Go on, dear. Go sleep.</i>

947
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,666
<i>Don't think about all this.</i>

948
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:01,958
<i>Also, you are a girl.</i>

949
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,958
<i>You should do what we say.</i>
<i>Live the way we tell you to.</i>

950
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,500
<i>Then only it will do good to you.</i>

951
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,166
<i>Father, I am not going to leave</i>
<i>the village.</i>

952
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,625
<i>I promised Grandpa that I would</i>
<i>protect his tree at all costs.</i>

953
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,916
<i>Tree... Tree... that goddamn tree!</i>

954
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,208
<i>Your Grandpa hung around that tree</i>
<i>his whole life.</i>

955
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:20,000
<i>Seems he passed his</i>
<i>madness on to you.</i>

956
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:22,750
<i>Everyone in the village used to</i>
<i>laugh at him.</i>

957
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:24,958
<i>Called him mad for always talking</i>
<i>with that tree.</i>

958
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,166
<i>So what, father?</i>

959
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,375
<i>Grandpa loved that tree.</i>
<i>What is wrong about that?</i>

960
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:30,958
<i>I swore to Grandpa.</i>
<i>He trusted me to protect that tree.</i>

961
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:32,708
<i>I have already sold the land.</i>

962
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:33,791
<i>Understand?</i>

963
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,333
<i>Anyway, you're just a child.</i>
<i>Why should I listen to you?</i>

964
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:38,041
<i>From now on, I will decide everything.</i>

965
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,208
<i>My wish! I will do whatever I please.</i>

966
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:42,000
<i>Do you understand?</i>
<i>Go. Go inside!</i>

967
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:44,166
<i>Gandhi!</i>

968
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:54,291
<i>Where were you the entire evening?</i>

969
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,125
<i>Your father was very angry at you, </i>
<i>he just went to sleep.</i>

970
01:02:56,916 --> 01:02:59,375
<i>It's been late, why didn't you go to sleep?</i>

971
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:01,750
<i>How can I sleep without you?</i>

972
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,458
<i>Ma, why did Dad have to sell the land?</i>

973
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:15,000
<i>Psst...</i>

974
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,500
<i>Are you still thinking about that?</i>
<i>Let it go.</i>

975
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:19,875
<i>We should do whatever dad says.</i>

976
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:20,958
<i>Okay?</i>

977
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:23,458
<i>But I gave Grandpa my word.</i>

978
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:26,583
<i>Poor Grandpa! I'm sure he feels bad.</i>

979
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,291
<i>He put his trust in me.</i>

980
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:31,666
<i>What can you do now, Gandhi?</i>

981
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,416
<i>Tell me, what can you do.</i>

982
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,041
<i>I'll do something</i>
<i>so that we earn back our money.</i>

983
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:39,583
<i>That way, we can buy back our land.</i>

984
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,583
<i>It's not that easy, dear.</i>

985
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,458
<i>How do you plan to make money?</i>

986
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,208
<i>Hm?</i>

987
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:50,833
<i>I don't know.</i>

988
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:52,041
<i>No clue.</i>

989
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,791
<i>But I'll definitely save that tree.</i>

990
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,041
<i>Or else Grandpa will feel bad.</i>

991
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,666
<i>Look at you.</i>

992
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,166
<i>You think about those alive.</i>

993
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,208
<i>You think about those who're gone.</i>

994
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:09,291
<i>If you keep thinking about everyone else,</i>

995
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,541
<i>how will you survive in this world?</i>

996
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:15,666
<i>It's late. Come and have dinner.</i>

997
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
<i>Gandhiâ€¦</i>

998
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,458
<i>Gandhi!</i>

999
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,458
<i>Tsk. Eat and sleep, child.</i>

1000
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,958
<i>How will you survive, dear?</i>

1001
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:28,166
<i>You don't get angry, don't hurt others, </i>

1002
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:30,541
<i>don't know how to lie to others... </i>

1003
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:35,875
<i>It's not possible to live</i>
<i>an idealistic life like your grandfather. </i>

1004
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,666
<i>This world is too cruel towards good people.</i>

1005
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:53,916
<i>Sin theta...</i>

1006
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,750
<i>by Cos theta...</i>

1007
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,750
<i>is equal to...</i>

1008
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,541
<i>Tan theta.</i>

1009
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:10,333
<i>Miss Attentive!</i>

1010
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:14,041
<i>You don't want to take notes? You think</i>
<i>you can remember everything?</i>

1011
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,291
<i>No, sir.</i>

1012
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:17,166
<i>I can't see the board clearly.</i>

1013
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:20,541
<i>Silence!</i>

1014
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:25,083
<i>Your eyesight's grown weak.</i>

1015
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:28,708
<i>You may have to</i>
<i>start wearing spectacles.</i>

1016
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,500
<i>Go get checked by the eye doctor in town.</i>

1017
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,250
<i>Ask your father to take you.</i>

1018
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,458
<i>My father won't take me.</i>

1019
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,166
<i>He's angry with me.</i>

1020
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
<i>Shall I take you?</i>

1021
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:41,791
<i>Would you?</i>

1022
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:43,791
<i>I have around...</i>

1023
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,125
<i>seven rupees.</i>

1024
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:54,833
<i>Sineâ€¦</i>

1025
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:18,625
<i>Grandpa told me you were his best friend.</i>

1026
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,375
<i>I don't know why he asked me to</i>
<i>protect you.</i>

1027
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,583
<i>No one will listen to me.</i>

1028
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:27,250
<i>Have you got any ideas?</i>

1029
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,125
<i>The Truth Crusade!</i>

1030
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:58,208
<i>Can we go home now?</i>

1031
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:00,625
<i>Let's wait a little longer, Mallesh.</i>

1032
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:04,541
<i>You're always in a hurry to go</i>
<i>home, saying</i>

1033
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:06,791
<i>your mom will scold you or your dad</i>
<i>will hit you.</i>

1034
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,291
<i>How come today</i>
<i>you suddenly want to stay longer?</i>

1035
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:10,541
<i>Is everything okay at home?</i>

1036
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,375
<i>Things are fine.</i>

1037
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:15,541
<i>Can you guys give me some ideas?</i>

1038
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,291
<i>I want to save the tree.</i>

1039
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,541
<i>We don't have any. Ask your Gandhiji.</i>

1040
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:20,875
<i>Gandhiji would haveâ€¦</i>

1041
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,708
<i>advised us to do a Salt Satyagraha!</i>

1042
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:24,916
<i>But we don't have a sea in our village.</i>

1043
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,666
<i>That's okay. If not a Salt Satyagraha</i>

1044
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,125
<i>you can do a Sugar Satyagraha.</i>

1045
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,250
<i>The whole village is filled</i>
<i>with sugarcane.</i>

1046
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:33,833
<i>Sugar Satyagraha?</i>

1047
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,541
<i>Yeah, Gandhi.</i>

1048
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:38,250
<i>Take all the sugarcane in the village...</i>
<i>and make sugar.</i>

1049
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:39,416
<i>We can sell the sugar.</i>

1050
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,041
<i>We'll make a lot of money!</i>

1051
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:50,333
<i>Done! Let's find out how to make sugar.</i>

1052
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:51,541
<i>Urgent.</i>

1053
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,666
<i>Bro, what's wrong with her?</i>
<i>She gets weirder everyday.</i>

1054
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:55,958
<i>I swear, Mallesh.</i>

1055
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:57,458
<i>I went to the temple yesterday.</i>

1056
01:07:57,833 --> 01:08:01,250
<i>I promised Goddess Yellama I'll buy her a</i>
<i>nice saree, if she cures Gandhi.</i>

1057
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:05,208
<i>Ma, do you know how to make sugar?</i>

1058
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,458
<i>Sugar?</i>

1059
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,750
<i>There's lots of it at home.</i>
<i>Do you want to eat some?</i>

1060
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:09,958
<i>That's not what I'm asking.</i>

1061
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:11,541
<i>Can we make sugar at home?</i>

1062
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,250
<i>How can one make sugar</i>
<i>at home, child?</i>

1063
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,791
<i>They make it in factories.</i>

1064
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,541
<i>How do they process sugar?</i>

1065
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,750
<i>They make sugar with the help of some machines.</i>

1066
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,875
<i>Leave it all..</i>

1067
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,541
<i>If you want sugar, I'll give you some.</i>

1068
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:24,500
<i>Hey! Do you know how to make sugar?</i>

1069
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:30,583
<i>Brother...</i>

1070
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:32,375
<i>Do you know how to make sugar?</i>

1071
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,583
<i>Sugar?</i>

1072
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:34,916
<i>They make it in the factory.</i>

1073
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,541
<i>How do they make it in the factory?</i>

1074
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:41,166
<i>They put sugarcane in a machine...</i>

1075
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,416
<i>it comes out as sugar.</i>

1076
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:45,375
<i>Can we make sugar without machines?</i>

1077
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:48,416
<i>I don't know, dear.</i>

1078
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,500
<i>Okay.</i>

1079
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,916
<i>I'll leave now.</i>

1080
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,166
<i>P...</i>

1081
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,333
<i>T...</i>

1082
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,666
<i>O-C.</i>

1083
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
<i>PTOC.</i>

1084
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:14,583
<i>Sir, do you know how to make sugar?</i>

1085
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
<i>Sugar?</i>

1086
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:18,166
<i>You take some sugarcane.</i>

1087
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:20,666
<i>Throw it in a big boiler and boil it.</i>

1088
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:23,708
<i>Afterwards, mix molasses</i>
<i>in the boiler.</i>

1089
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,375
<i>As a result, a layer will be formed...</i>

1090
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,375
<i>Is Chenulu awake, Aunty?</i>

1091
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,875
<i>What are you doing here so late?</i>

1092
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,083
<i>Pack some sugarcane and</i>
<i>come to the fort tomorrow.</i>

1093
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:45,041
<i>Tomorrow is a Sunday, Gandhi.</i>

1094
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:47,458
<i>You woke me up</i>
<i>to tell me to bring sugarcane juice?</i>

1095
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,583
<i>We are going to make Sugar tomorrow!</i>

1096
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:53,125
<i>Weren't you the one who gave me the</i>
<i>Sugar Satyagraha idea?</i>

1097
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,833
<i>Fine. I'll do it. Now go home.</i>

1098
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,166
<i>Idiot wants sugarcane juice</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

1099
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,166
<i>Hey Gandhi, are you making Sugar?</i>

1100
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,791
<i>If you don't make sugar, you will die in</i>
<i>our hands</i>

1101
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:15,083
<i>I gave you the idea. If this works,</i>
<i>you have to give me credit.</i>

1102
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:16,166
<i>Understood?</i>

1103
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,666
<i>What is happening?</i>

1104
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,916
<i>It needs to get thicker.</i>

1105
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:22,791
<i>So make it thicker.</i>

1106
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,375
<i>I shouldn't have to make it.</i>

1107
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:25,916
<i>It should get thicker by itself.</i>

1108
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,375
<i>Why does it look like this?</i>

1109
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:34,375
<i>They told me if I make it like this,</i>
<i>it'll become sugar.</i>

1110
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,541
<i>That lunatic told you</i>
<i>and you followed it blindly.</i>

1111
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:39,416
<i>Please don't tell anyone</i>
<i>this was my idea.</i>

1112
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,541
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1113
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,500
<i>I'll lose my reputation in the village.</i>

1114
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:44,166
<i>Why are you crying, Gandhi?</i>

1115
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,833
<i>I thought that if we manage to make sugar,</i>

1116
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:49,958
<i>we could solve all</i>
<i>the problems in the village.</i>

1117
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:54,166
<i>I knew something like this would happen.</i>

1118
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,416
<i>Don't cry, Gandhi.</i>
<i>Look, at least you tried.</i>

1119
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:03,041
<i>- Where you going?</i>
<i>- She is going to make sugar, as if !</i>

1120
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,000
<i>Gandhi...</i>

1121
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,083
<i>Gandhi...</i>

1122
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:18,750
<i>Your mother asked for lentils...</i>

1123
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:19,916
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

1124
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,916
<i>What happened, dear?</i>
<i>Come, sit with me.</i>

1125
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:25,583
<i>What's that in your hand?</i>

1126
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:27,625
<i>Do you want laddus?</i>

1127
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:30,083
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Let me get some!</i>

1128
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,833
<i>No brother, I really don't want it.</i>

1129
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,958
<i>What happened, dear?</i>
<i>Why are you so sad?</i>

1130
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,625
<i>I thought I could make sugar.</i>

1131
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,791
<i>But I made a mess instead.</i>

1132
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:40,166
<i>Really? Show me.</i>

1133
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,625
<i>Dear, you set out to make sugar,</i>

1134
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,666
<i>but you've made jaggery instead!</i>

1135
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:56,791
<i>What?</i>

1136
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:57,875
<i>Show me your palm.</i>

1137
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:00,666
<i>Put it in your mouth</i>

1138
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:05,458
<i>Oh yes, brother, this is jaggery!</i>

1139
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,000
<i>One must never cry on a Sunday.</i>

1140
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,750
<i>Go. Go play with your friends.</i>

1141
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:11,750
<i>Okay Brother, Thank you.</i>

1142
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:12,833
<i>Bye.</i>

1143
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:15,208
<i>Child your bag!</i>

1144
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:27,708
<i>Brother!</i>

1145
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,708
<i>Can I get 1 kilo of jaggery?</i>

1146
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:33,208
<i>Jaggery... I'm out of jaggery.</i>
<i>I'll get some tomorrow.</i>

1147
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:36,708
<i>What? My daughter wants to make sweet</i>
<i>rice-pudding to offer at the temple.</i>

1148
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,166
<i>I don't have any. Come tomorrow.</i>

1149
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,250
<i>Fine.</i>

1150
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,208
<i>Sister! Sister!</i>

1151
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:44,833
<i>Come back, come back.</i>

1152
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:47,791
<i>Gandhi made this jaggery.</i>

1153
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:49,083
<i>What? Gandhi makes jaggery?</i>

1154
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:50,708
<i>Yes. It tastes good too.</i>

1155
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:52,875
<i>Weighs around 1 kg.</i>
<i>Should be enough, right?</i>

1156
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:54,250
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Here, take it.</i>

1157
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:19,791
<i>Sister! This tastes so good.</i>
<i>How did you make it?</i>

1158
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:20,875
<i>It tastes divine.</i>

1159
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,166
<i>Isn't it?</i>

1160
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,708
<i>My daughter makes</i>
<i>the same rice-pudding every year.</i>

1161
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:27,000
<i>Must be because of the jaggery</i>
<i>from the shopkeeper.</i>

1162
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,083
<i>Is that so?</i>

1163
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:31,416
<i>- Our Gandhi made the jaggery!</i>
<i>- Gandhi knows how to make Jaggery?</i>

1164
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,041
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Even I want some.</i>

1165
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:34,666
<i>Ask our shopkeeper.</i>

1166
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,750
<i>Alright.</i>

1167
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,416
<i>Brother...</i>

1168
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,041
<i>do you have Gandhi's jaggery?</i>

1169
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:45,125
<i>Gandhi jaggery?</i>

1170
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,875
<i>What's that?</i>
<i>A new brand in town?</i>

1171
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:49,833
<i>Samakka bought some the other day.</i>
<i>From your shop.</i>

1172
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,750
<i>Oh! You mean the Jaggery</i>
<i>that Gandhi made?</i>

1173
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,583
<i>That's over.</i>
<i>I'll give you something else.</i>

1174
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,500
<i>No, we want only that. Get it for us.</i>

1175
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,041
<i>Yes, I'll get it.</i>

1176
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:59,291
<i>- It's compulsory.</i>
<i>- Okay, I'll get it.</i>

1177
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,666
<i>What are you thinking now?</i>

1178
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,583
<i>I beg you. Don't get any new ideas.</i>

1179
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:12,958
<i>Aye...</i>

1180
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,375
<i>Bro.</i>

1181
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,291
<i>I think she'll make chilli powder,</i>

1182
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:18,125
<i>now that the sugar idea flopped.</i>

1183
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,625
<i>Guys, did I tell you?</i>

1184
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:24,416
<i>The sugar I made the other day was</i>
<i>jaggery, the shopkeeper told me.</i>

1185
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,583
<i>It's is not true. That can't be jaggery.</i>

1186
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:27,916
<i>I swear. I ate it too.</i>

1187
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,583
<i>Nah! If you'd eaten it, you'd be dead.</i>

1188
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,416
<i>I swear, I'm not lying.</i>
<i>I left the bag with the shopkeeper.</i>

1189
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,083
<i>You can taste it.</i>

1190
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,458
<i>Brother.</i>

1191
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,375
<i>I'm actually looking for you.</i>

1192
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:41,708
<i>I left the bag of jaggery with you.</i>

1193
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,791
<i>Do you have it?</i>

1194
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:44,000
<i>That's over.</i>

1195
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,000
<i>Can you make me another 10 kilos, child?</i>

1196
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:47,541
<i>10 kilos?</i>

1197
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:50,458
<i>The other day Samakka made sweet</i>
<i>rice-pudding with your jaggery.</i>

1198
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:54,083
<i>Everyone in the village ate it and praised</i>
<i>your jaggery. They all want to buy it.</i>

1199
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:56,208
<i>Can you make me some? I'll pay you.</i>

1200
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:58,541
<i>You'll pay for that jaggery?</i>

1201
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:01,125
<i>I'll pay. I need it urgently.</i>
<i>Many people are asking for it.</i>

1202
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:03,166
<i>- Well? Can you make it?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1203
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,916
<i>- You will, right?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1204
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,416
<i>Come, let's go.</i>

1205
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,708
<i>Brother,</i>

1206
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:11,208
<i>swear on your wife and tell me.</i>
<i>Was that really Jaggery?</i>

1207
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,125
<i>Aye... you go away.</i>

1208
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,083
<i>Brother, can you give me some</i>
<i>sugarcane juice?</i>

1209
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:12,125
<i>What's going on, child?</i>
<i>What are you up to?</i>

1210
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,541
<i>I told you</i>

1211
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,375
<i>I'm making 10 kilos of jaggery.</i>

1212
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:17,375
<i>10 kilos of jaggery?</i>

1213
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,625
<i>Mmm. You made all this jaggery?</i>

1214
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,125
<i>Yes, ma.</i>

1215
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,708
<i>With our sugarcane?</i>

1216
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,375
<i>Mmm. It tastes so good, Gandhi!</i>

1217
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:31,875
<i>How did you manage it?</i>

1218
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:35,041
<i>I don't know. It must be</i>
<i>our village's sugarcane.</i>

1219
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,625
<i>Grandpa used to say</i>

1220
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:39,416
<i>there is nothing sweeter than</i>
<i>our village's sugarcane.</i>

1221
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:40,958
<i>Just like us.</i>

1222
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:42,916
<i>Is that so? I don't think so.</i>

1223
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
<i>You made it, right?</i>

1224
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,166
<i>That's why it's so sweet.</i>

1225
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,416
<i>Show me your hand.</i>

1226
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,000
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>
<i>It's because of your hand.</i>

1227
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,500
<i>Your hand tastes so sweet!</i>

1228
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:55,666
<i>- How is it so sweet?</i>
<i></i>

1229
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:00,541
<i>What will you do,</i>
<i>selling all this Jaggery?</i>

1230
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:04,375
<i>I'll save up the money,</i>

1231
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,041
<i>give it to the factory and</i>

1232
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:07,875
<i>ask them to return all our lands.</i>

1233
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,041
<i>I'll tell them we don't need</i>
<i>their factory.</i>

1234
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,541
<i>I'll also tell them</i>
<i>not to cut Grandpa's tree.</i>

1235
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,375
<i>My sweet child!</i>

1236
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,583
<i>Oh Gandhi! Come here.</i>

1237
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:21,541
<i>Tell me, sister.</i>

1238
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,291
<i>I made sweet rice-pudding with your</i>
<i>jaggery. It tasted so good!</i>

1239
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,250
<i>The shopkeeper told me. Thank you.</i>

1240
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:28,250
<i>Do you have more?</i>
<i>I want to buy some.</i>

1241
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,291
<i>I just gave the shopkeeper 10 kilos.</i>

1242
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,125
<i>- You can buy some there.</i>
<i>- Alright.</i>

1243
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:34,541
<i>Gandhi, how does one make Jaggery?</i>

1244
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,666
<i>First, you take some sugarcane juice...</i>

1245
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:42,166
<i>I don't know how to explain it, sister.</i>

1246
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,416
<i>I'll make some and show you.</i>

1247
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,000
<i>Show me.</i>
<i>I have a lot of sugarcane with me.</i>

1248
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:47,291
<i>I'll also make and sell.</i>

1249
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,166
<i>I'll get to make some money too.</i>

1250
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:51,250
<i>Why do you want money, sister?</i>

1251
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,625
<i>I'll give it to my husband. He'll buy back</i>
<i>our land. We sold our lands right?</i>

1252
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:56,958
<i>Then all of you come here on Sunday.</i>

1253
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,291
<i>Bring everyone.</i>
<i>I'll teach everyone.</i>

1254
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,333
<i>Okay? Don't forget!</i>

1255
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:07,125
<i>Such an innocent child. Don't know</i>
<i>how she'll survive in this world.</i>

1256
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:09,583
<i>Diwakar, why don't you give</i>
<i>me a hundred rupees?</i>

1257
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:10,875
<i>I don't have any money.</i>

1258
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,958
<i>Why are you lying to me, Diwakar?</i>

1259
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:15,208
<i>I heard your daughter is in</i>
<i>the jaggery business.</i>

1260
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,541
<i>Gandhi?</i>

1261
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:18,916
<i>Yeah, Diwakar.</i>

1262
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:21,958
<i>No way. She's not that smart.</i>

1263
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:24,375
<i>Also, why would I take</i>
<i>my daughter's money?</i>

1264
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:27,250
<i>My wife is making sweets</i>
<i>with her jaggery today.</i>

1265
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,875
<i>I swear, Diwakar.</i>

1266
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:32,500
<i>My father spoiled her too much.</i>

1267
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,583
<i>That is why she is crossing her limits.</i>

1268
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
<i>Diwakar.</i>

1269
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,875
<i>Listen to me. Get her married.</i>

1270
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:40,791
<i>If she's already so independent,</i>
<i>she won't listen to you.</i>

1271
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,333
<i>What do you mean, married?</i>

1272
01:18:42,416 --> 01:18:43,750
<i>She's still a small girl.</i>

1273
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,750
<i>So? She's attained puberty, hasn't she?</i>

1274
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,166
<i>You can get her married.</i>

1275
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,083
<i>I heard you're making jaggery</i>
<i>and selling it to the shop.</i>

1276
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:05,458
<i>Yes!</i>

1277
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,916
<i>See, I made some money too!</i>

1278
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,708
<i>I sent you to school to study.</i>

1279
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:14,041
<i>Not to start selling jaggery.</i>

1280
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,125
<i>Huh?</i>

1281
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:17,583
<i>Did I ask you to do it?</i>

1282
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,833
<i>Am I a joke now in this house?</i>

1283
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:23,000
<i>Please calm down. She's a small</i>
<i>girl. She didn't think so much.</i>

1284
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,125
<i>I'll talk her out of it.</i>

1285
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:26,333
<i>Your Grandfather</i>
<i>pampered you too much.</i>

1286
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:29,750
<i>That's why you're spoilt. Only way to set</i>
<i>you straight is to get you married.</i>

1287
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:31,666
<i>Huh? What do you mean, marriage?</i>

1288
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:33,000
<i>Have you gone mad?</i>

1289
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,583
<i>You go inside.</i>

1290
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,666
<i>- She's a small chi...</i>
<i>- She's no more a small child.</i>

1291
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,958
<i>She's hit puberty.</i>

1292
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:40,375
<i>Yadagiri saw her</i>
<i>at the temple the other day.</i>

1293
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:42,583
<i>- I told them she's ready.</i>
<i>- They're coming tomorrow.</i>

1294
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:44,750
<i>I'm sorry, Father.</i>

1295
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:47,750
<i>They're coming tomorrow.</i>
<i>If they like you, I'm getting you married.</i>

1296
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:49,333
<i>No more studies.</i>

1297
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,375
<i>What? Why do you want</i>
<i>to get her married now?</i>

1298
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:53,958
<i>Please reconsider your decision.</i>

1299
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:59,208
<i>She is doing as she pleases. Unless we get</i>
<i>her married, she won't come to her senses.</i>

1300
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,208
<i>I didn't do all this...</i>
<i>to make you angry, Father.</i>

1301
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:04,666
<i>I just wanted to help you.</i>

1302
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:06,958
<i>You do without getting angry</i>

1303
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,416
<i>From now on, don't do anything.</i>

1304
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,083
<i>I can take care of things at home.</i>

1305
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:01,250
<i>Gandhi, are you awake?</i>

1306
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:04,500
<i>The boy's parents are on their</i>
<i>way to see you.</i>

1307
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:13,041
<i>Where are you off to?</i>

1308
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:15,416
<i>I have something urgent to do.</i>
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

1309
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:17,500
<i>If you're not here by the time they come,</i>

1310
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:18,875
<i>your father will kill me.</i>

1311
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,458
<i>- I'll be back by the time they come.</i>
<i>- Be quick!</i>

1312
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,125
<i>Brother!</i>

1313
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:46,791
<i>Tell me, Gandhi.</i>

1314
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:57,958
<i>Where's your daughter, brother?</i>

1315
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:00,625
<i>You've offered us the same drink</i>
<i>three times since we came.</i>

1316
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,958
<i>She'll be back. She's gone to the</i>
<i>shop nearby.</i>

1317
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:04,041
<i>I only sent her.</i>

1318
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,500
<i>Where did she go?</i>

1319
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:10,833
<i>Is she coming or not?</i>

1320
01:22:12,416 --> 01:22:13,625
<i>Are you sure you want this?</i>

1321
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,375
<i>I am serious, brother!</i>

1322
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:17,541
<i>Once I remove it, you can't stick it back.</i>

1323
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,333
<i>I know. Remove it.</i>

1324
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:21,208
<i>Have you pledged your hair to God?</i>

1325
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:23,333
<i>Nothing like that. Why?</i>

1326
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:26,000
<i>Let me remove a little? It'll look good.</i>

1327
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,166
<i>No, brother. Go ahead.</i>
<i>Shave my head.</i>

1328
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,291
<i>It's just hair. It'll grow back.</i>

1329
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:31,750
<i>I warned you. Now it's your wish.</i>

1330
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:38,166
<i>"Like the goddess Lakshmi, </i>
<i>your face is so bright,"</i>

1331
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:42,541
<i>"Your mother says a beauty </i>
<i>spot on it looks very pretty."</i>

1332
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:46,833
<i>" Your eyes are so wide like a lake"</i>

1333
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:51,166
<i>"The black kohl makes it so attractive."</i>

1334
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:56,833
<i>"Your thick curly hair is the</i>
<i>secret behind your beauty."</i>

1335
01:22:56,833 --> 01:23:01,291
<i>"The earrings for your ears are so lovely"</i>

1336
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:08,500
<i>"But, Oh moon, what is real beauty?</i>
<i>Tell me, Oh moon."</i>

1337
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:14,333
<i>"The bangles, the clothes, the powder, the perfume"</i>

1338
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:20,208
<i>"The flowers in your hair, </i>
<i>everything will fade away in a dayâ€¦"</i>

1339
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:24,583
<i>"The courage in your heart is the true beauty"</i>

1340
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,750
<i>"The sparkle in your eyes is timeless beauty"</i>

1341
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:37,125
<i>"To wear bravery on your sleeve is the finest beauty"</i>

1342
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,416
<i>"The path you believe in is so beautiful for you"</i>

1343
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:43,083
<i>"The wish you like is so beautiful for you"</i>

1344
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,333
<i>"Beauty is when you stand on your own feet"</i>

1345
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:49,250
<i>"Beauty is when you help others with your spirit"</i>

1346
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:55,583
<i>"Oh, my dear moon,</i>
<i>Oh, my dear moon"</i>

1347
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:21,958
<i>Is this your girl?</i>

1348
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:23,708
<i>Yes, sister.</i>

1349
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:30,041
<i>Why didn't you tell us your girl</i>
<i>was bald?</i>

1350
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:33,250
<i>I shaved my hair just now.</i>

1351
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:36,500
<i>My parents too just got to know.</i>

1352
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:41,166
<i>If the girl is bald,</i>
<i>she won't look good in the wedding.</i>

1353
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:44,375
<i>We'll leave now.</i>

1354
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,583
<i>You have shamed me in front of everyone.</i>

1355
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:58,791
<i>Stop, now.</i>

1356
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:01,916
<i>You scared her with all this.</i>
<i>That's why she shaved her head.</i>

1357
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:06,291
<i>I'll find someone who'll agree to marry</i>
<i>you, even if you are bald.</i>

1358
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:11,500
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

1359
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:20,208
<i>Once upon a time, a bird left its nest</i>
<i>and flew away</i>

1360
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:25,083
<i>One by one, all the other</i>
<i>birds also flew the same way</i>

1361
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:29,875
<i>Once, a drop of rain fell on the ground</i>

1362
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:34,958
<i>All the clouds followed the raindrop</i>
<i>and poured themselves down</i>

1363
01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:38,125
<i>With a fistful of salt and fire</i>
<i>in his heart,</i>

1364
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:40,375
<i>Gandhi performed</i>
<i>the Dandi March one day</i>

1365
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:43,083
<i>With a piece of sugarcane and with</i>
<i>sweetness in her heart</i>

1366
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:45,541
<i>this Gandhi started</i>
<i>her stubborn march that day</i>

1367
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:50,250
<i>With a lean body and a heart of iron,</i>
<i>Gandhi walked ahead alone</i>

1368
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:55,500
<i>Determined to find the solution, this girl</i>
<i>walked ahead with resolution</i>

1369
01:25:56,583 --> 01:26:00,708
<i>She hugged the branch and called the</i>
<i>tree her own</i>

1370
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:05,833
<i>When crisis arose in the village,</i>
<i>she decided to fight</i>

1371
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:11,375
<i>Wilfully she walked the path of thorns</i>

1372
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:16,000
<i>And then, the whole village decided</i>
<i>to join</i>

1373
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,333
<i>A fighter!</i>

1374
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:19,500
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1375
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:21,708
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1376
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:24,458
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1377
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:28,166
<i>A fighter!</i>

1378
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,666
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1379
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:31,916
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1380
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:34,708
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1381
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:36,250
<i>A fighter!</i>

1382
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:41,333
<i>Once upon a time, a bird left its nest</i>
<i>and flew away</i>

1383

<i>All the clouds followed the raindrop</i>

1386
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,250

<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1388
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:52,625
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1389
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,375
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1390
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:59,083
<i>A fighter!</i>

1395
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,500

01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,625
<i>This girl is a fighter!</i>

1399
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,291
<i>A fighter!</i>

1400
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,333
<i>Mallesh and Chenulu, I have an idea.</i>

1401
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,583
<i>Now that we are making more money.</i>

1402
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:34,583
<i>we can ask all the villagers to buy</i>
<i>back their land.</i>

1403
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:39,666
<i>Land... Land...</i>
<i>always talking about Land.</i>

1404
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,250
<i>Sister...</i>

1405
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:54,541
<i>Sister...</i>

1406
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:58,666
<i>Brother.</i>

1407
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:00,000
<i>How did this happen, sister?</i>

1408
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:01,958
<i>What can I tell you, brother?</i>

1409
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,375
<i>The whole village is suffering like me.</i>

1410
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,541
<i>Six people have died so far.</i>

1411
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:09,916
<i>I begged him.. Not to sell our lands to</i>
<i>the factory people.</i>

1412
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,166
<i>But he sold them. It's been two years.</i>

1413
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:14,416
<i>We have no food to feed ourselves.</i>

1414
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,583
<i>We've exhausted all the money</i>
<i>we earned by selling our land.</i>

1415
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:21,916
<i>And now, he's left us. Could he not have</i>
<i>taken me and the kids with him?</i>

1416
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,166
<i>What is the point of me living?</i>

1417
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:47,333
<i>How could Suresh die so suddenly?</i>

1418
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:52,291
<i>Now what are his wife and kids</i>
<i>going to do?</i>

1419
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:58,125
<i>Even the neighbouring villages sold their</i>
<i>land and got duped by the factory people.</i>

1420
01:29:58,875 --> 01:30:01,041
<i>What will become of us?</i>

1421
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:03,583
<i>I'm really scared now.</i>

1422
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:07,166
<i>Ramachandrayya was right.</i>

1423
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,291
<i>He told us many times not to sell</i>
<i>our lands. That we'd be ruined.</i>

1424
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,166
<i>None of us listened to him.</i>

1425
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:19,541
<i>Hey Diwakar, how are you?</i>

1426
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,833
<i>Your girl has turned out really sharp.</i>

1427
01:30:23,458 --> 01:30:25,750
<i>It seems she earned 1200 rupees</i>
<i>in a month!</i>

1428
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:29,708
<i>You did a fine job raising her.</i>

1429
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,250
<i>She's gone to sleep.</i>

1430
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:06,666
<i>She's been running around a lot.</i>

1431
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,625
<i>The whole village is running behind her.</i>

1432
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,208
<i>It's getting on my nerves.</i>

1433
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:15,541
<i>Did she do something again?</i>

1434
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:18,458
<i>Are you angry?</i>

1435
01:31:20,333 --> 01:31:22,291
<i>If you are, please talk to her in</i>
<i>the morning.</i>

1436
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:23,458
<i>I feel bad for her.</i>

1437
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:24,791
<i>She's very tired.</i>

1438
01:31:24,875 --> 01:31:26,000
<i>Don't wake her up.</i>

1439
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:33,875
<i>What happened?</i>

1440
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:37,291
<i>All these years,</i>

1441
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,500
<i>I've never seen you cry even once.</i>

1442
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
<i>What happened, dear?</i>

1443
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:46,791
<i>Why are you falling at her feet?</i>

1444
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:55,333
<i>Our daughter is truly great.</i>

1445
01:31:57,208 --> 01:32:00,083
<i>My mother named me Diwakar, after her</i>
<i>father's name.</i>

1446
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:02,291
<i>But my father,</i>

1447
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:06,083
<i>he knew the whole village</i>
<i>would talk about her.</i>

1448
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,208
<i>That's why he wisely named</i>
<i>her 'Gandhi'.</i>

1449
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,916
<i>I have caused her great pain.</i>

1450
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,083
<i>My sweet child.</i>

1451
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:17,375
<i>Did you realise? She never once</i>
<i>raised her voice against me.</i>

1452
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:19,250
<i>She never once got angry with me.</i>

1453
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:22,458
<i>From whom did she learn to be so good?</i>

1454
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:25,416
<i>Most certainly not from us.</i>

1455
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:29,208
<i>I made a huge mistake, Yadamma.</i>

1456
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:33,625
<i>Never once did I try to understand her.</i>

1457
01:32:35,208 --> 01:32:36,541
<i>I should have at least tried.</i>

1458
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,250
<i>She would have achieved</i>
<i>so much more.</i>

1459
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:44,208
<i>My daughter will forgive me, won't she?</i>

1460
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:54,916
<i>Sorry, I'm not getting my daughter married so soon.</i>

1461
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:56,541
<i>Have gone mad, Diwakar?</i>

1462
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:58,041
<i>You called us to talk about the alliance, didn't you?</i>

1463
01:32:58,208 --> 01:32:59,208
<i>Sorry, brother. </i>

1464
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:03,375
<i>My daughter has to achieve a lot in her life. </i>
<i>Let her live her life as she wishes.</i>

1465
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:06,125
<i>Great job! You have insulted us well!</i>

1466
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,333
<i>When the neighbouring village people</i>
<i>started dying,</i>

1467
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:27,125
<i>Our people became wise.</i>

1468
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:30,333
<i>They realized their mistake.</i>

1469
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:31,750
<i>They went to the Village Head.</i>

1470
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:35,083
<i>Didn't you all sign? You've already sold</i>
<i>your land. The damage is done.</i>

1471
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:37,416
<i>Satish sir is coming to town in two days.</i>

1472
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:39,916
<i>There's nothing we can do now. Go home.</i>

1473
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:42,041
<i>All of you. Leave.</i>

1474
01:33:58,208 --> 01:34:00,416
<i>Someone called Satish is coming</i>
<i>to our village in a couple of days.</i>

1475
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:02,208
<i>What will happen if Satish comes here?</i>

1476
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,916
<i>You, fool... If he builds a factory here, </i>
<i>we all will be driven out of this village.</i>

1477
01:34:06,291 --> 01:34:09,083
<i>The village will be vacant, </i>
<i>we will be separated forever.</i>

1478
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:14,416
<i>Our parents have sold their lands,</i>
<i>now we have to make them re-purchase it.</i>

1479
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:15,875
<i>I don't understand anything. </i>

1480
01:34:15,875 --> 01:34:17,333
<i>Do you like our village?</i>

1481
01:34:17,416 --> 01:34:18,708
<i>A lot.</i>

1482
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:19,750
<i>Why?</i>

1483
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:24,958
<i>We are born here and we live here.</i>
<i>Our village is a beautiful place.</i>

1484
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:30,958
<i>Isn't it? But if they build their factory, </i>
<i>all the fields will be gone and so will we.</i>

1485
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:37,250
<i>We should all do the "Simon, go back!"</i>

1486
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:38,791
<i>Simon, what?</i>

1487
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,041
<i>A white man named Simon</i>

1488
01:34:41,125 --> 01:34:43,333
<i>came to our country to loot us.</i>

1489
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:46,208
<i>But Gandhiji assembled everyone,</i>

1490
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:47,916
<i>stood outside the train station</i>

1491
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,375
<i>and shouted "Simon, go back!"</i>
<i>till he left.</i>

1492
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:52,875
<i>What is it?</i>

1493
01:34:52,875 --> 01:34:54,125
<i>"Simon, go back!"</i>

1494
01:34:54,333 --> 01:34:56,250
<i>The same way, we should</i>
<i>shout, "Satish, go back!"</i>

1495
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:57,333
<i>Do you all understand?</i>

1496
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:59,583
<i>- Satish, go back!</i>
<i>- Yes! Just like that.</i>

1497
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:00,791
<i>Now, everyone shout.</i>

1498
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:04,208
<i>- Satish!</i>
<i>- Go back!</i>

1499
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:10,000
<i>- Satish!</i>
<i>- Go back!</i>

1500
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:39,666
<i>What is this nonsense?</i>
<i>Vehicles will hit you.</i>

1501
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:41,583
<i>Why these guys are not moving?</i>

1502
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:05,958
<i>Hey kids. Move aside.</i>

1503
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:11,041
<i>Blow the horn more</i>

1504
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:24,666
<i>I'm running out of time,</i>
<i>what game are you kids playing at?</i>

1505
01:36:24,666 --> 01:36:25,791
<i>What do you want?</i>

1506
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,083
<i>Satish!</i>

1507
01:36:29,166 --> 01:36:30,333
<i>Go Back!</i>

1508
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,458
<i>Satish!</i>

1509
01:36:31,541 --> 01:36:32,708
<i>Go Back!</i>

1510
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:33,916
<i>Satish!</i>

1511
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
<i>Go Back!</i>

1512
01:36:35,083 --> 01:36:36,791
<i>- Satish!</i>
<i>- Go Back!</i>

1513
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,458
<i>Satish!</i>

1514
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:39,708
<i>Go Back!</i>

1515
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:41,500
<i>- Satish</i>
<i>- Go Back!</i>

1516
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,416
<i>- Satish</i>
<i>- Go Back!</i>

1517
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,083
<i>Have they gone crazy?</i>

1518
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,166
<i>Ask them to move.</i>

1519
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:48,500
<i>No idea, sir, they won't listen to us.</i>

1520
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:50,291
<i>They won't tell us what happened either.</i>

1521
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:53,541
<i>They are yelling something in English.</i>
<i>We don't understand them.</i>

1522
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:55,208
<i>They want me to go back!</i>

1523
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:57,708
<i>- Is that so?</i>
<i>- Tell them to move!</i>

1524
01:36:57,875 --> 01:36:59,541
<i>Kids, get up!</i>

1525
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,791
<i>Get up. I am talking to you, boy.</i>

1526
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:04,708
<i>Sir, these kids simply</i>
<i>won't listen to us.</i>

1527
01:37:05,041 --> 01:37:06,958
<i>Let them be. Why don't you</i>
<i>come back tomorrow.</i>

1528
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:09,541
<i>What! Here comes your Village Head.</i>
<i>I will talk to him.</i>

1529
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:11,541
<i>What happened, sir?</i>

1530
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:14,458
<i>They're not allowing me to enter. They're</i>
<i>shouting, "Satish, Go Back!".</i>

1531
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:17,291
<i>Kids, what is this fuss? Please get up.</i>

1532
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:19,333
<i>- Get all of them up.</i>
<i>- All of you, get up.</i>

1533
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,583
<i>All of you, get up!</i>

1534
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:23,041
<i>They're not moving, sir.</i>

1535
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:24,791
<i>Shall I hit them?</i>

1536
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:28,666
<i>Don't be an idiot.</i>
<i>Go get their parents.</i>

1537
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:32,208
<i>Hey Kids. Don't you want to listen to us?</i>

1538
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,000
<i>How much longer do I have to wait?</i>

1539
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:45,625
<i>I've become a bloody joke to them.</i>

1540
01:37:48,833 --> 01:37:50,000
<i>Let's leave</i>

1541
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:52,375
<i>- What's up with the kids?</i>
<i>- Why are they sitting here?</i>

1542
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:54,000
<i>What is wrong with them?</i>

1543
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:55,791
<i>Did anyone do anything to them?</i>

1544
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,166
<i>What do you want?</i>

1545
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:05,625
<i>Give back our lands.</i>

1546
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:07,375
<i>We will sell jaggery and pay you back.</i>

1547
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:09,250
<i>How is that possible?</i>

1548
01:38:09,916 --> 01:38:11,125
<i>Or else we won't get up.</i>

1549
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:18,666
<i>Village Head, if they don't get up,</i>
<i>I will have to call the Minister.</i>

1550
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,541
<i>You know what the</i>
<i>consequences will be.</i>

1551
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:21,958
<i>Just wait a while, sir.</i>

1552
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:24,666
<i>Go move your kids.</i>

1553
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:28,166
<i>- Move them immediately</i>
<i>- Drag them away if you have to.</i>

1554
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:28,750
<i>Over actions.</i>

1555
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:31,500
<i>This is what happens when you</i>
<i>mess with me.</i>

1556
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:48,500
<i>Please spare my Grandfather's tree.</i>

1557
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,958
<i>I promised my Grandfather</i>
<i>I would protect it.</i>

1558
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:53,791
<i>Oh, I see!</i>

1559
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:58,166
<i>So, the tree is the issue. That means if I</i>
<i>take it down, you'll learn your lesson.</i>

1560
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,041
<i>Get lost.</i>

1561
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,041
<i>Make way for me.</i>

1562
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:14,708
<i>- My god! -He is planning to cut down</i>
<i>Ramachandrayya's tree.</i>

1563
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:18,625
<i>You have to let it go.</i>

1564
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:38,500
<i>Please tell them not to, father.</i>

1565
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:41,750
<i>Please tell them not to cut down the tree.</i>

1566
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:45,125
<i>You tried your best to stop this.</i>
<i>Let it go.</i>

1567
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:46,500
<i>You have to let it go.</i>

1568
01:40:55,958 --> 01:40:58,375
<i>What are you looking at?</i>
<i>Start chopping.</i>

1569
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:37,125
<i>Brother!</i>

1570
01:41:37,375 --> 01:41:40,250
<i>Sir, this tree is bleeding.</i>

1571
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,250
<i>What? Blood?</i>

1572
01:41:43,041 --> 01:41:44,041
<i>Blood?</i>

1573
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:49,166
<i>Show me.</i>

1574
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:54,500
<i>They say the tree is bleeding.</i>

1575
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:57,416
<i>- The tree is bleeding...</i>
<i>- The tree is bleedingâ€¦</i>

1576
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,375
<i>I have never seen such a thing</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

1577
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:02,791
<i>What is this, priest?</i>

1578
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:05,833
<i>Don't panic, all of you.</i>
<i>I will be right back.</i>

1579
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:08,000
<i>What is this, sir?</i>

1580
01:42:08,083 --> 01:42:11,583
<i>I my whole life,</i>
<i>I've never seen a tree bleed!</i>

1581
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,416
<i>Why do you think it's bleeding?</i>

1582
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:15,625
<i>How would I know? Only God knows why!</i>

1583
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:18,041
<i>- God?</i>
<i>- Yes, it's probably God's miracle.</i>

1584
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,625
<i>This is God's doing, the</i>
<i>Village Head just said so.</i>

1585
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:23,500
<i>Look madam, that is not what he meant.</i>

1586
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:25,416
<i>He only said, God knows why it's bleeding.</i>

1587
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,125
<i>Red bus candidates.</i>

1588
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:30,666
<i>Keep quiet. All of you,</i>
<i>stop making wild guesses.</i>

1589
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:33,000
<i>I don't know if this is God's doing.</i>

1590
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,916
<i>Then what's there in the tree?</i>

1591
01:42:35,291 --> 01:42:36,875
<i>Why is blood oozing out of the tree?</i>

1592
01:42:37,083 --> 01:42:39,333
<i>I think Ramachanraayya's spirit</i>
<i>is in the tree.</i>

1593
01:42:39,416 --> 01:42:41,166
<i>What, is there a ghost in it?</i>

1594
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,250
<i>Our Ramachandrayya was a good man.</i>

1595
01:42:43,333 --> 01:42:44,583
<i>How can he be a ghost?</i>

1596
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:48,541
<i>Will y'all please shut up?</i>
<i>Always making a drama out of everything.</i>

1597
01:42:48,875 --> 01:42:50,291
<i>Why have you guys stopped?</i>

1598
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:53,458
<i>Dad, what is there in the tree?</i>

1599
01:42:54,333 --> 01:42:57,000
<i>I have no idea, dear.</i>
<i>I can't understand anything either.</i>

1600
01:42:57,833 --> 01:43:01,208
<i>Please step aside.</i>

1601
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:27,083
<i>Turmeric can stop the bleeding.</i>

1602
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,708
<i>Each of you, come forward and apply</i>
<i>turmeric to the tree.</i>

1603
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:34,750
<i>Oh sister, where are you going?</i>

1604
01:43:58,041 --> 01:43:59,291
<i>This is not a good omen.</i>

1605
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,500
<i>A tree bleeding is not a minor thing.</i>

1606
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:04,708
<i>This does not mean well for you or for</i>
<i>the village.</i>

1607
01:44:11,416 --> 01:44:14,833
<i>Okay, thank you!</i>
<i>Now all of you can leave.</i>

1608
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:16,166
<i>I will take care of my tree.</i>

1609
01:44:16,833 --> 01:44:18,416
<i>Why are you staring at me like that?</i>

1610
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,291
<i>Please sir, why are you</i>
<i>talking like that?</i>

1611
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:22,125
<i>Don't be stubborn and cut it down.</i>

1612
01:44:22,291 --> 01:44:24,333
<i>- I am requesting you. sir. Please leave.</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1613
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:27,875
<i>It is against God's will for you</i>
<i>to construct a factory.</i>

1614
01:44:27,958 --> 01:44:30,458
<i>We are begging you, sir. Give back our</i>
<i>lands.</i>

1615
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:32,083
<i>We don't want a factory.</i>

1616
01:44:32,166 --> 01:44:34,666
<i>- We will give back your money.</i>
<i>- Yes sir. We will, sir. Please, sir.</i>

1617
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,250
<i>- Yes sir.</i>
<i>- Please sir.</i>

1618
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:37,541
<i>Is this some kind of a joke?</i>

1619
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:38,916
<i>Hey you, go chop that tree.</i>

1620
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,666
<i>I'm scared, sir.</i>

1621
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:42,416
<i>What are you scared of?</i>
<i>Give me the axe.</i>

1622
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,625
<i>Sir... Sir... I beg you. Sir</i>

1623
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:48,041
<i>Who knows what is there in that tree?</i>
<i>Could be god, ghost, or Ramachandarayya.</i>

1624
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,416
<i>Spare the tree, sir.</i>

1625
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,250
<i>Hey, who are you to talk to me</i>
<i>like this?</i>

1626
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,541
<i>- He pushed Sir. Don't spare him.</i>
<i>- Get him!</i>

1627
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:56,541
<i>How dare he push our Village</i>
<i>Head. Get him!</i>

1628
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:59,625
<i>Beat him up! This is all because of him.</i>
<i>He came to ruin us.</i>

1629
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:03,166
<i>We won't let you go, sir.</i>

1630
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:05,833
<i>Please don't hit him.</i>

1631
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:08,625
<i>Gandhi, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Step aside.</i>

1632
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:09,875
<i>I won't step aside.</i>

1633
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:11,375
<i>It's all my fault, so hit me.</i>

1634
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:12,791
<i>You don't know anything, Gandhi.</i>

1635
01:45:12,875 --> 01:45:14,166
<i>He cheated all of us.</i>

1636
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:15,416
<i>He grabbed our lands.</i>

1637
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,416
<i>Step aside. We will teach him a lesson.</i>

1638
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,125
<i>I'm not moving from here.</i>

1639
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,000
<i>Move aside.</i>

1640
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:40,625
<i>Move aside.</i>

1641
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:30,208
<i>Scion of the Raghu clan</i>

1642
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:34,333
<i>Lord Raam</i>

1643
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:40,416

<i>All your divine names</i>

1647
01:47:00,458 --> 01:47:03,833
<i>Grant us wisdom and Harmony</i>

1648
01:47:04,916 --> 01:47:07,208
<i>O Lord</i>

1649
01:47:18,041 --> 01:47:21,041
<i>Gandhi's words</i>

1650
01:47:23,666 --> 01:47:26,500
<i>were her blessing</i>

1651
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:31,083
<i>They became the light</i>

1652
01:47:34,333 --> 01:47:36,958
<i>that showed her the path</i>

1653
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,916
<i>Let the violence end</i>

1654
01:47:45,458 --> 01:47:48,416
<i>Let love be the answer</i>

1655
01:47:50,583 --> 01:47:53,708
<i>Let truth win</i>

1656
01:47:55,833 --> 01:47:58,208
<i>Today</i>

1657
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,166
<i>Let kindness be</i>

1658
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,166
<i>our religion</i>

1659
01:48:09,666 --> 01:48:13,583
<i>Let us do a Satyagraha to</i>

1660
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:21,583
<i>fight for what is right</i>

1661
01:49:04,708 --> 01:49:09,916
<i>Scion of the clan of Raghu, Lord Raam</i>

1662
01:49:10,083 --> 01:49:15,083
<i>Uplifter of the fallen,</i>
<i>Sita's helpmeet Raam</i>

1663
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:25,583
<i>Eashwar, Allah, all your divine names</i>

1664
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:30,916
<i>Grant us wisdom and harmony, O Lord</i>

1665
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:36,500
<i>Scion of the clan of Raghu, Lord Raam</i>

1666
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:41,333
<i>Uplifter of the fallen,</i>
<i>Sita's helpmeet Raam</i>

1667
01:49:58,041 --> 01:50:00,625
<i>Ah! Ouch!</i>

1668
01:50:01,708 --> 01:50:05,166
<i>It still hurts a little.</i>
<i>But I am very happy today.</i>

1669
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:10,375
<i>Everyone was surprised to see a</i>
<i>tree bleed.</i>

1670
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:13,041
<i>Who would believe it?</i>

1671
01:50:13,791 --> 01:50:17,833
<i>But I was surprised to see our Gandhi.</i>

1672
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:22,958
<i>Our little Gandhi who learnt to walk</i>
<i>and talk just yesterday,</i>

1673
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:27,500
<i>saved the entire village. My god.</i>

1674
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:31,875
<i>If Ramachandrayya were alive,</i>
<i>he would have been so proud!</i>

1675
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:35,083
<i>From where did she get this strength?</i>

1676
01:50:35,708 --> 01:50:38,375
<i>Some people are like that.</i>

1677
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:40,750
<i>They are not limited.</i>

1678
01:50:40,833 --> 01:50:42,625
<i>They can achieve anything.</i>

1679
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:45,708
<i>Everyone wants to join hands with them.</i>

1680
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,083
<i>The whole world.</i>

1681
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:50,500
<i>Even Nature supports them.</i>

1682
01:50:51,291 --> 01:50:55,458
<i>When Lord Ram laid rocks in the ocean,</i>
<i>they floated.</i>

1683
01:50:56,166 --> 01:50:59,750
<i>When Lord Krishna tried</i>
<i>to lift the mountain,</i>

1684
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:02,583
<i>the mountain sat on</i>
<i>his little finger.</i>

1685
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,125
<i>If you were to ask why,</i>

1686
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:08,916
<i>the answer is in their intentions.</i>

1687
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,875
<i>They intended the good of everyone.</i>

1688
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:14,750
<i>Our Gandhi's intention was good,</i>

1689
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:18,958
<i>and so our village won.</i>
<i>Good won in our village.</i>

1690
01:51:19,791 --> 01:51:21,125
<i>That's it! That's our story.</i>

1691
01:51:21,625 --> 01:51:24,250
<i>If you ever come around here,</i>
<i>come to our village.</i>

1692
01:51:24,666 --> 01:51:28,500
<i>I can't move from here anyway.</i>
<i>You see the temple there,</i>

1693
01:51:28,666 --> 01:51:34,125
<i>if you turn right from</i>
<i>there and come into the fields.</i>

1694
01:51:34,208 --> 01:51:36,083
<i>I'll be right here.</i>

1695
01:51:37,958 --> 01:51:38,958
<i>See you!</i>
